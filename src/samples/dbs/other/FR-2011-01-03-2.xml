          <P>The Rural Housing Service (RHS) (an agency within the Rural Development mission area) is amending its regulations to add an additional form of guarantee that is now available under its Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program. A single, continuous guarantee during the construction phase for construction advances and the permanent financing phase of the project (for loans that meet certain criteria) will now be provided in addition to the two existing forms of guarantees under the program. This action is taken to enhance efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness in managing the program.</P>

        <P>This rule has been determined not to be significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12988</HD>
        <P>This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. If this rule is adopted: (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided, all State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule except as specifically prescribed in the rule; and (3) the appeal procedures of the National Appeals Division (7 CFR part 11) must be exhausted before bringing suit.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), Public Law 104-4, establishes requirements for Federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments and the private sector. Under section 202 of the UMRA, the Agency generally must prepare a written statement, including a cost-benefit analysis, for final rules with “Federal mandates” that may result in expenditures to State, local, or Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. When such a statement is needed for a rule, section 205 of the UMRA generally requires the Agency to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt the least costly, more cost-effective or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule. This rule contains no Federal mandates (under the regulatory provisions of Title II of the UMRA) for State, local, and Tribal governments or the private sector. Therefore, this rule is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 of the UMRA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>The policies contained in this rule do not have any substantial direct effect on States, on the relationship between the National government and States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Nor does this rule impose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments. Therefore, consultation with the States is not required.</P>

        <P>This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The undersigned has determined and certified by signature of this document that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will affect both small and large entities in the same manner.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background Information</HD>
        <P>The Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program (GRRHP) currently offers two forms of guarantees: (1) A guarantee for permanent loans and (2) a guarantee which provides a limited duration guarantee for advances during the construction period with the limited duration provision being automatically removed if certain conditions are met. Under this final rule, the Agency creates, for loans meeting certain criteria and subject to the availability of funds, an option for a single, continuous guarantee during the construction phase for construction advances and the permanent financing phase of the project. This third option was created in response to input from GRRHP stakeholders who believe that this option will allow the program to serve more borrowers thus making affordable housing available for more low to moderate income families. This final rule also includes technical corrections and clarifications and removes the anachronistic requirement that lenders certify that their computer systems comply with year 2000 technology. The proposed rule can be found at 75 FR 4707-4710. Additionally, this final rule removes the definition for “combination construction and permanent loan” and added definitions for “construction and permanent loan,” “construction contingency reserve,” “lease-up period,” “lease-up reserve,” “loan-to-cost ratio,” and “operating and maintenance reserve.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments Received on the Proposed Rule</HD>
        <P>On January 29, 2010, RHS (an agency within the Rural Development mission area) proposed an additional form of guarantee under the Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program regulation. The Agency received comments from five entities in response to the proposed rule. Comments were supportive of the new guarantee option offered in the proposed rule. One commenter stated that they supported the additional form of guarantee and applauded RHS' work in this area. The commenter believed the continuous guarantee will reduce the complexity of the program, making housing affordable for more low to moderate income families. Another commenter also stated that the continuous guarantee is a good idea and that it would provide a financing vehicle for additional multifamily housing construction. The Agency appreciates the support received from commenters in regard to the new continuous guarantee option. Specific comments were also received in three particular areas: Construction contingency reserve, the guarantee requirements, and the processing requirements. These comments are summarized below.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Construction Contingency Reserve</HD>
        <P>Two comments were received regarding the construction contingency reserve. The first comment was related to the definition provided in the proposed rule which read: “This reserve will be held by the lender and will only be disbursed for Agency and lender approved change order requests.” The commenter's concern was that, as written, the language could be interpreted to mean that change order requests need only be approved by the Agency or the lender. The commenter recommended the language be rewritten to provide that the funds will only be disbursed for change order[s] requests that are approved by both the Agency and the lender. In response to this comment, the Agency has revised the definition to read: “A cash reserve of at least two percent of the construction contract, inclusive of the contractor's fee and all hard and soft costs, which must be set up and fully funded by the closing of the construction loan. This reserve will be held by the lender, and funds will only be disbursed for change order requests approved by the Agency and the lender.”</P>
        <P>The second comment on construction contingency reserve stated that it would be useful to clarify the timing of the release of unused reserve funds as there are inconsistent interpretations among various State agencies. The commenter recommended releasing these funds at the same time that the 90/90 reserve funds are released. In response to this comment the Agency has revised the definition to clarify when the unused reserve funds will be released.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Guarantee Requirements</HD>

        <P>The Agency received three comments regarding the guarantee requirements. One commenter recommended removal of the following language in § 3565.52(c)(3) which the commenter viewed as unnecessary: “Only projects that have low loan-to-cost ratio, as specified by the Agency in a Notice published periodically in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, are eligible for this type of guarantee.” The Agency believes this language serves the purpose of advising readers up front that specific eligibility criteria in relation to what constitutes low loan-to-cost ration is subject to change and appropriate notification will take place periodically in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Accordingly, this language was unchanged.</P>

        <P>The second commenter asked what is intended by the term “low loan-to-cost ratio” in § 3565.52(c)(3). The commenter further stated that this [achieving a low loan-to-cost ratio] should not be a problem for Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties but could be for other properties, and that RHS should not arbitrarily limit the availability of the new guarantee. In response to this comment, the Agency reserves the right in the regulation to periodically publish a threshold in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>to define the ratio that will be considered “low”. The definition for “loan-to-cost ratio” was unchanged.</P>

        <P>The third commenter stated that it is not clear in the proposed rule how the required lease-up reserve (in § 3565.52(c)(3)) will be calculated and expressed a concern that adding on a “substantial” lease-up reserve that must be funded up front (in § 3565.52(e)(3)) is burdensome on the project and would make the program much less useful. Specific administrative guidance on calculating the lease-up reserve will be announced through a Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Supplemental guidance will be included in HB-1-3565, the Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program Origination and Servicing Handbook (available in any Rural Development office), and will not be published in the rule. In response to the commenter's second concern, the Agency has revised the final rule to require that the lease-up reserve be funded 30 days before first Certificate of Occupancy is anticipated (rather than up front).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Processing Requirements</HD>

        <P>In terms of processing requirements, the Agency received three comments. The first commenter asked that the word “independent” be removed from § 3565.303(c)(3). Section 3565.303(c)(3) which states that inspections must be done by an “independent” inspector. The commenter stated the requirement is that the inspector must be “qualified.” The Agency agrees that the inspector must be qualified to perform inspections but in order to avoid potential conflicts<PRTPAGE P="3"/>of interest; the inspector must also be independent and cannot be affiliated with the borrower or lender. This language remains in the rule.</P>
        <P>The second comment on this subject was to remove in § 3565.303(d)(4) the requirement regarding an as-built appraisal. The commenter recommended making this required under certain circumstances in order to reduce the number of exemptions that would need to be processed. In response, the Agency revised the final rule to clarify that the as-built appraisal is required only for Options 1 and 2, but not for Option 3 (the continuous guarantee).</P>
        <P>The final comment the Agency received on this subject was to change the requirement in § 3565.303(d)(4)(iii) that the Agency's guaranteed loan balance not exceed 50% (in order to qualify for an exception to the as-built appraisal). The commenter recommended that this figure be revised to be 90%. The commenter's point was that if a construction loan can be done at 90% and then rolled into a permanent loan, there is no difference in risk, and loans with less leveraging can be more easily moved into the secondary market. As noted above, the as-built appraisal is required only for Options 1 and 2, but not for Option 3 (the continuous guarantee) so this provision does not apply.</P>
        <P>In addition, a conforming change has been added as section 3565.303(f). Though the continuous guarantee will be seamless from the construction phase to the permanent financing phase, the loan must still be in compliance with 7 CFR part 3565. Section 3565.303(f) simply clarifies the specific requirements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Eligible loans and advances.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Upon approval of an application from an eligible or approved lender, the Agency will commit to providing a guarantee for a permanent loan or a construction and permanent loan, subject to the availability of funds.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <AMDPAR>4. Section 3565.52 is amended by revising paragraph (c) and adding new paragraphs (d) and (e) to read as follows:</AMDPAR>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 3565.52</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Conditions of guarantee.</SUBJECT>
            <STARS/>
            <P>(c)<E T="03">Types of guarantees.</E>The Agency may provide a lesser guarantee based upon its evaluation of the credit quality of the loan. Penalties incurred as a result of default are not covered by the guarantee. The Agency liability under any guarantee will decrease or increase, in proportion to any increase or decrease in the amount of the unpaid portion of the loan, up to the maximum amount specified in the Loan Note Guarantee. The Agency will not guarantee construction loans only. The Agency offers the following types of guarantees:</P>
            <P>(1)<E T="03">Option One.</E>The Agency may guarantee permanent loans subject to the conditions specified in § 3565.303(d). The maximum guarantee for a permanent loan will be 90 percent [unless the Agency establishes a different percent and announces this different percent through a Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>] of the unpaid principal and interest up to default and accrued interest 90 calendar days from the date the liquidation plan is approved by the Agency, as defined in § 3565.452.</P>
            <P>(2)<E T="03">Option Two.</E>The Agency may provide a guarantee which will cover construction loan advances (advances) during construction. The maximum guarantee of construction advances related to a construction and permanent loan will not at any time exceed the lesser of 90 percent [or the percent established by the Agency and announced through a Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>] of the amount of principal and accrued interest up to default for amounts which exceed the original advance if for eligible uses of loan proceeds or 90 percent of the original principal amount and accrued interest up to default of the loan. The Agency's guarantee will cover losses to<PRTPAGE P="4"/>the extent aforementioned once all sureties/insurances and/or performance and payment bonds have fully performed their contractual obligations. A construction contingency reserve is required. This guarantee will be enforceable during the construction period but will cease to be enforceable once construction is completed unless and until the requirements for the continuation of the guarantee contained in the Conditional Commitment and this part are completed and approved by the Agency by the date stated in the Conditional Commitment and any Agency approved extension(s). The Agency will provide written confirmation to the lender when all of the requirements for continuation of the guarantee to cover the permanent loan have been satisfied. Any losses sustained while the guarantee is unenforceable (after the end of the construction period and, if applicable, before the continuation of the guarantee) are not covered by the guarantee. For purposes of this guarantee, the construction period will end on the earlier of:</P>
            <P>(i) Twenty-four months from the closing of the construction loan, if the certificates of occupancy for all units in the project have not been issued by then, or</P>
            <P>(ii) The date of the issuance of the last certificate of occupancy, if the certificates of occupancy for all units in the project are issued on or before 24 months from the closing of the construction loan.</P>
            <P>(3)<E T="03">Option Three.</E>The Agency may provide a single, continuous guarantee for construction and permanent loans. Only projects that have low loan-to-cost ratios, which will be defined by the Agency in a Notice published periodically in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, are eligible for this type of guarantee. A construction contingency reserve is required. The Agency may require that a lease-up reserve, in an amount established by the Agency and announced through a Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, be set-aside prior to closing the construction loan. This lease-up reserve is an additional amount, over and above the required initial operating and maintenance contribution. The maximum guarantee of construction advances will not at any time exceed the lesser of 90 percent [or the percent established by the Agency and announced through a Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>] of the amount of principal and interest up to default advanced for eligible uses of loan proceeds or 90 percent of the original principal amount and interest up to default.</P>
            <P>(d)<E T="03">Maximum loss payment.</E>The maximum loss payment to a lender or holder is as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) To any holder, 100 percent of any loss sustained by the holder on the guaranteed portion of the loan and on interest due on such portion.</P>
            <P>(2) To the lender, the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(i) Any loss sustained by the lender on the guaranteed portion, including principal and up to 90 days of accrued interest as evidenced by the notes or assumption agreements and secured advances for protection and preservation of collateral made with the Agency's authorization; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The guaranteed principal advanced to or assumed by the borrower and any interest and accrued interest up to 90 days due thereon.</P>
            <P>(e)<E T="03">Funding of reserves.</E>For each Option under paragraph (c) of this section, the lender must require an operating and maintenance reserve and provide the Agency adequate evidence of the funding of all required reserves.</P>
            <P>(1) For Option 1 under paragraph (c) of this section, the funding schedule for the lease-up reserve and the operating and maintenance reserve must be included in the Agency-approved construction budget and be fully funded before the issuance of the permanent guarantee.</P>
            <P>(2) For Option 2 under paragraph (c) of this section, the funding schedule for the lease-up reserve and the operating and maintenance reserve must be included in the Agency-approved construction budget and be fully funded before the issuance of the permanent guarantee.</P>
            <P>(3) For Option 3 under paragraph (c) of this section, the operating and maintenance reserve must be fully funded before the issuance of the guarantee. The lease-up reserve must be funded 30 days before the first Certificate of Occupancy is anticipated.</P>

            <STARS/>
            <P>(c)<E T="03">Guarantee during construction.</E>When requesting a guarantee on construction loan advances under § 3565.52(c)(2) and (c)(3), Options 2 and 3, the Agency will only issue a guarantee to an approved lender that the Agency determines is eligible under § 3565.106 of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) This guarantee will be subject to the limits contained in subpart B of this part and in the loan closing documentation.</P>
            <P>(2) In all cases, the lender must obtain one of the following protections:</P>
            <P>(i) Surety bonding or performance and payment bonding acceptable to the Agency;</P>
            <P>(ii) An irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the Agency; or</P>

The lender must provide verification that all subcontractors have been paid and no liens have been filed against the property.</P>
            <P>(d)<E T="03">Permanent loan guarantee.</E>The guarantee of a permanent loan provided under § 3565.52(c)(1) or (c)(2) will be issued once the following items have been submitted to and approved by the Agency:</P>
            <P>(1) Certification from the lender stating that the lender or its qualified representative inspected the property and found that the construction meets the Government's requirements for the standards and conditions for housing and facilities in 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A and the standards for site development in 7 CFR part 1924, subpart C, or its successor regulations;</P>
            <P>(2) Cash flow certification—the lender certifies, in writing, the project's cash flow assumptions are still valid and depict compliance with the section 538 program's debt service coverage ratio requirement of at least 1.15, based on the lender's analysis of current market conditions and comparable properties in the project's market area;</P>
            <P>(3) Documentation that either:</P>
            <P>(i) The project has attained a minimum level of acceptable occupancy of 90% for 90 continuous days within the 120-day period immediately preceding the issuance of the permanent guarantee, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Additional funds, supplementing the funds required under § 3565.303(d), have been added to the lease-up reserve in an amount the Agency determines is necessary to cover projected shortfalls.</P>

            <P>(4) A new appraisal based upon completion of construction. Upon a<PRTPAGE P="5"/>lender's written request, the Agency may exempt a project from this requirement if requested by the lender and the project meets the following criteria:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it establishes minimum standards required in the interest of safety for the design of aircraft.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Currently, the definition of light-sport aircraft in § 1.1 General Definitions, Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), specifies that powered gliders that are light-sport aircraft have a fixed or autofeathering propeller system. The restriction to “autofeathering” has resulted in varying applications of light-sport aircraft (LSA) design.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the FAA issued the final rule “Certification of Aircraft and Airmen for the Operation of Light-Sport Aircraft” (Sport Pilot Rule) (69 FR 44772, July 27, 2004). That rule established a definition for the term “light-sport aircraft.” Since we adopted that rule, the FAA has been working with the LSA industry in evaluating the overall LSA program. The past five years have seen remarkable growth in the overall LSA industry. Over 1,200 new factory-built airplanes, powered parachutes, and weight-shift control aircraft have received special airworthiness certificates in the special LSA category. One exception to this rapid growth is LSA powered gliders.</P>
        <P>The FAA has determined that a propeller on a LSA powered glider can be safely feathered using either a manual or automatic feathering propeller system, which justifies replacing the term “autofeathering” with “feathering.” We discuss this determination in the following section.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Feathering Propeller Systems for Soaring Flight</HD>
        <P>When we published the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Certification of Aircraft and Airmen for the Operation of Light-Sport Aircraft on February 5, 2002 that proposed a definition for LSA, we intended that LSA be simple in design and operation and appropriate for operation by sport pilots. For aircraft design, low performance within the constraints of light weight and structural integrity were important. For aircraft operation, simple mechanical systems within the constraints of sport pilot training requirements were important. In that NPRM (67 FR 5376), we stated that “a light sport aircraft, if powered, would be limited to a fixed or ground adjustable propeller.” We determined that “a propeller that could not be adjusted in pitch during flight was necessary to limit the operational complexity of the aircraft and would be consistent with the skills necessary to hold a sport pilot certificate.”</P>
        <P>Some commenters requested that controllable pitch propellers be permitted on LSA. We disagreed that the LSA definition should be revised accordingly because it would require a level of training for sport pilots and repairmen that would not be commensurate with the privileges of their certificates. However, for powered gliders, we revised the final rule to permit autofeathering propeller systems on LSA powered gliders to decrease drag while soaring.</P>
        <P>In June 2008, the Light Aircraft Manufacturers Association (LAMA) petitioned the FAA for an exemption to allow manual feathering of a propeller in LSA powered gliders. As part of its request, LAMA provided information concerning the design and operation of manual feathering propeller systems. This petition can be found in Docket No. FAA-2008-0737.</P>

        <P>The FAA received approximately 16 comments from 13 commenters in response to the petition. All the commenters supported the petition for exemption. Comments on the petition highlighted the overall benefits for a<PRTPAGE P="7"/>LSA powered glider to have the option of being equipped with a manual feathering propeller system.</P>
        <P>After reviewing LAMA's petition and the comments received in support of it, the FAA has determined that a change to the definition of LSA for powered gliders is appropriate. The FAA agrees that autofeathering propeller systems are not necessary for the safe operation of LSA powered gliders. These systems, which are typically found in multi-engine aircraft, automatically feather a propeller in the event of a power loss during takeoff. These systems can be complex, heavy, and expensive.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, powered gliders typically incorporate a simple, manual feathering propeller system. These simple, two-position manual feathering systems are more consistent with the intended use of a LSA powered glider and the expected level of complexity for LSA operations. For example, these systems allow the pilot to feather the propeller by toggling a switch or moving a lever in the cockpit. This system rotates the propeller blades to be aligned with the wind—from power configuration to soaring configuration—so that the glider may maximize gained altitude through thermal lift only. The ability to feather the propeller is desirable when the glider is aloft and the engine has been intentionally shut off.</P>

        <P>A manual feathering propeller system is the lightest, simplest, and most direct way to rotate the propeller blades from power configuration to soaring configuration. This translates to a lower glider weight that may result in better performance and fewer parts or systems that could fail (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>better reliability) than with autofeathering systems, while still maintaining low cockpit workload and pilot distraction.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Design and Standards</HD>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Sport Pilot rule and the revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119, “Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities,” dated February 10, 1998, the LSA industry and the FAA have been working with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International to develop consensus standards for aircraft issued special airworthiness certificates in the LSA category under § 21.190 for Special Light-Sport Aircraft (S-LSA). These consensus standards, once accepted by the FAA, satisfy the agency's goal for airworthiness certification and establish a verifiable minimum safety level for S-LSA. In addition, use of the consensus standard process assures government and industry that discussion and agreement on appropriate standards have occurred for the required level of safety.</P>
        <P>We believe a simple manually operated propeller system for in-flight feathering would be an acceptable means of compliance with the propeller feathering provisions for LSA.</P>
        <P>From the aircraft design perspective, we were concerned that malfunction or misuse of a manual feathering propeller on an LSA powered glider could impose a hazard to the aircraft occupants. Since publication of the Sport Pilot Rule, the FAA has reviewed powered glider accident statistics in the electronic database of the National Transportation Safety Board. The data show 32 accidents in the years 1962 through 2009 (October) with no accidents attributed to the operation of feathering or un-feathering a propeller during flight. The data also indicate that in-flight feathering of a propeller system in powered gliders—many of which are permitted to use either manual or autofeathering propeller system—does not decrease safety.</P>
        <P>We find that a manually operated propeller system for in-flight feathering is appropriate. Currently, pilots flying LSA powered gliders are allowed to use a direct-action manual lever to operate the landing gear, which typically occurs at low altitudes during times of high pilot workload. By contrast, feathering the propeller takes place at higher altitudes when pilot workload is minimal. We have determined that this revision to the definition of a LSA recognizes the operational nature of LSA powered gliders and is consistent with the stated design and safety objectives.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)) requires the FAA to consider the impact of paperwork and other information collection burdens imposed on the public. We have determined that there are no current or new requirements for information collection associated with this amendment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">International Compatibility</HD>
        <P>In keeping with U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA has determined there are no International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices that correspond to this regulation. International standards for Light Sport Aircraft are being coordinated by ASTM International.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Good Cause for “No Notice”</HD>
        <P>Section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) authorizes agencies to dispense with certain notice procedures for rules when they find “good cause” to do so. Under section 553(b)(B), the requirements of prior notice and opportunity for comment do not apply when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”</P>
        <P>This final rule will change the definition of LSA powered glider by removing “auto” from “autofeathering,” which will eliminate the current restriction on manual feathering propeller designs. Prior public comment is unnecessary because the FAA has already obtained public comments regarding a petition for exemption seeking to eliminate the restriction on manual feathering propeller designs from the definition of light-sport aircraft. This final rule is responsive to those comments, all of which were in support of the petition for exemption.</P>
        <P>We do not anticipate significant public comment on this amendment, since it does not impose a requirement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, directs the FAA to assess both the costs and benefits of a regulatory change. We are not allowed to propose or adopt a regulation unless we make a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Our assessment of this final rule indicates that its economic impact is minimal.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Evaluation, Regulatory Flexibility Determination, International Trade Impact Assessment, and Unfunded Mandates Assessment</HD>

        <P>Changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) requires agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Trade Agreements Act (Public Law 96-39) prohibits<PRTPAGE P="8"/>agencies from setting standards that create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States. In developing U.S. standards, this Trade Act also requires agencies to consider international standards and, where appropriate, that they be the basis of U.S. standards. Fourth, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) requires agencies to prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final rules that include a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditure by State, local or Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more annually (adjusted for inflation with the base year of 1995). This portion of the preamble summarizes the FAA's analysis of the economic impacts of this final rule.</P>
        <P>Department of Transportation Order DOT 2100.5 prescribes policies and procedures for simplification, analysis, and review of regulations. If the expected cost impact is so minimal that a proposed or final rule does not warrant a full evaluation, this order permits that a statement to that effect and the basis for it be included in the preamble if a full regulatory evaluation of the cost and benefits is not prepared. Such a determination has been made for this final rule. The reasoning for this determination is that the rule is cost relieving, as it eliminates the current restriction on manual feathering propeller designs while maintaining the current safety level.</P>
        <P>FAA has therefore determined that this final rule is not a “significant regulatory action” as defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and is not “significant” as defined in DOT's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Determination</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) (RFA) establishes “as a principle of regulatory issuance that agencies shall endeavor, consistent with the objectives of the rule of applicable statutes, to fit regulatory and informational requirements to the scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to the regulation. To achieve this principle, agencies are required to solicit and consider flexible regulatory proposals and to explain the rationale for their actions to assure that such proposals are given serious consideration.” The RFA covers a wide range of small entities, including small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Agencies must perform a review to determine whether a rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If the agency determines it will, the agency must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis as described in the RFA. However, if an agency determines that a rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, section 605(b) of the RFA provides that the head of the agency may so certify and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The certification must include a statement providing the factual basis for this determination, and the reasoning should be clear. This rule will not have a significant economic impact because it is cost relieving.</P>
        <P>Therefore, as the FAA Administrator, I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">International Trade Impact Assessment</HD>
        <P>The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39), as amended by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Pub. L. 103-465), prohibits Federal agencies from establishing standards or engaging in related activities that create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States. Pursuant to these Acts, the establishment of standards is not considered an unnecessary obstacle to the foreign commerce of the United States, so long as the standard has a legitimate domestic objective, such the protection of safety, and does not operate in a manner that excludes imports that meet this objective. The statute also requires consideration of international standards and, where appropriate, that they be the basis for U.S. standards. The FAA has assessed the potential effect of this final rule with request for comments and has determined that it will have a cost relieving impact on domestic and international entities and thus has a neutral trade impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Unfunded Mandates Assessment</HD>
        <P>Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) requires each Federal agency to prepare a written statement assessing the effects of any Federal mandate in a proposed or final agency rule that may result in an expenditure of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation with the base year 1995) in any one year by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector; such a mandate is deemed to be a “significant regulatory action.” The level equivalent of $100 million in CY 1995, adjusted for inflation to CY 2010 levels by the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is $143.1 million.</P>
        <P>This final rule with request for comments does not contain such a mandate. Therefore, the requirements of Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to this regulation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Executive Order 13132, Federalism</HD>
        <P>The FAA has analyzed this final rule with request for comments under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 13132, Federalism. We determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, or the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, we have determined that this final rule with request for comments does not have federalism implications.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Analysis</HD>
        <P>FAA Order 1050.1E identifies FAA actions that are categorically excluded from preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. The FAA has determined this proposed rulemaking action qualifies for the categorical exclusion identified in paragraph 312 and involves no extraordinary circumstances.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>The FAA has analyzed this final rule with request for comments under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use (66 FR 28355, May 18, 2001). We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under the executive order, and it is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator to issue, rescind, and revise regulations. Under this authority, we are amending Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 103 in 14 CFR part 65 (SFAR 103) by removing paragraph 5.b.vii. The change is within the scope of our authority and is a reasonable and necessary exercise of our statutory obligations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>

        <P>On January 23, 2004, H.R. 2673, Consolidated Appropriations 2004, became Public Law 108-199. Within the appropriations bill, there was a mandate that “not later than March 1, 2004, the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, shall issue final regulations, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8335, establishing an exemption process allowing individual Air Traffic Controllers to delay mandatory retirement until the employee reaches no later than 61 years of age.” On January 7, 2005, the FAA published the final rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, 14 CFR part 65 (Docket No. FAA-2004-17334; SFAR No. 103, 70 FR 1634).</P>
        <P>The process for an Air Traffic Control Specialist (ATCS) to request a waiver from the mandatory separation age of 56 is currently codified in SFAR 103 and reflected in the Human Resources Policy Bulletin 35, Waiver Process to Mandatory Separation at Age 56. This policy applies to all ATCSs and their first-level supervisors in flight service, enroute and terminal facilities, and at the David J. Hurley Air Traffic Control System Command Center covered under the mandatory separation provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8335(a) and 8425(a).</P>
        <P>The regulation contains information contrary to air traffic policy under amended FAA Order JO 7210.56C, Change 2, effective July 20, 2009. Specifically, paragraph 5.b.vii. of SFAR 103 requires a controller to provide a statement that they have not been involved in an operational error (OE), operational deviation (OD), or runway incursion in the last 5 years while in a control position. This requirement is inconsistent with current air traffic orders developed specifically to foster a safety culture that encourages full and open reporting of safety information and focuses on determining why events occur, rather than placing blame. In support of this culture, FAA Order JO 7210.56C, Change 2 removed all references to employee identification, training record entries, performance management, and return-to-duty actions that were historically tied to reported OE or OD events. Due to this change in policy, the reporting requirements of SFAR 103 5.b.vii. became unverifiable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Summary of the NPRM</HD>
        <P>The FAA published the NPRM on June 2, 2010. (75 FR 30742, Docket No. FAA 2010-0567) The proposed rule invited comments on the proposal to remove paragraph 5.b vii of SFAR 103, since current practice made those provisions unverifiable. The proposed rule would amend only the requirement for controllers to provide a statement that they have not been involved in an operational error (OE), operational deviation (OD), or runway incursion in the last 5 years while in a control position. The proposal did not affect any other requirements for Air Traffic Controllers who request a waiver.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Summary of Comments</HD>

        <P>The comment period for the NPRM closed on July 2, 2010. The FAA received comments from two individuals on the proposal to amend the exemption process allowing ATC to delay mandatory retirement age. Both commenters supported waivers to extend the retirement age in general, and one commenter was also in favor of the specific proposal to remove documentation of any occurrences within the preceding 5 years. The other commenter suggested removing the<PRTPAGE P="10"/>mandatory retirement age completely and focusing on the controller's ability to concentrate and do their job properly. This suggestion, however, was outside the scope of the current rulemaking.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Discussion of the Final Rule</HD>
        <P>The FAA is adopting as final the proposed rule published on June 2, 2010. The final rule will become effective March 4, 2011.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)) requires that the FAA consider the impact of paperwork and other information collection burdens imposed on the public. We have determined that there is no new information collection requirement associated with this rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">International Compatibility</HD>
        <P>In keeping with U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to conform with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA has determined that there are no ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices that correspond to these regulations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Evaluation, Regulatory Flexibility Determination, International Trade Impact Assessment, and Unfunded Mandates Assessment</HD>
        <P>Changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) requires agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Trade Agreements Act (Pub. L. 96-39) prohibits agencies from setting standards that create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States. In developing U.S. standards, this Trade Act requires agencies to consider international standards and, where appropriate, that they be the basis of U.S. standards. Fourth, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) requires agencies to prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final rules that include a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditure by State, local, or Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more annually (adjusted for inflation with base year of 1995). This portion of the preamble summarizes the FAA's analysis of the economic impacts of this rule.</P>
        <P>Department of Transportation Order DOT 2100.5 prescribes policies and procedures for simplification, analysis, and review of regulations. If the expected cost impact is so minimal that a proposed or final rule does not warrant a full evaluation, this order permits that a statement to that effect and the basis for it be included in the preamble if a full regulatory evaluation of the cost and benefits is not prepared. The FAA has made such a determination for this rule.</P>
        <P>This rule will moderately streamline the process for ATCSs who are requesting a waiver of mandatory separation at age 56 by eliminating a paperwork obstacle. Currently, ATCSs need to provide a statement to certify that they have not been involved with an operational error (OE), operational deviation (OD), or runway incursion within the previous 5 years when submitting a request for a waiver of the mandatory separation at age 56. This rule will eliminate this certification requirement by reducing the written information ATCSs must provide, resulting in a cost saving.</P>
        <P>We estimate ATCSs submit an average of 54 statements per year. ATCSs need approximately 5 minutes to prepare each statement, whereas air traffic managers need approximately 15 minutes to review them. The ATCS's salary including benefits expressed as an hourly wage rate with benefits is estimated to be $125 per hour;<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>and an air traffic manager's hourly rate with benefits is estimated to be $155 per hour.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>This wage rate is based on 1657.7 hours. 2,080 hours (52 weeks times 40 hours per week) minus 422.3 hours (the number of hours a typical controller is not available to work) equals 1,657.7.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Using the preceding information, the FAA estimates that the total cost savings of this final rule will be about $26,000 or $18,000 present value, as shown in Table 1.</P>

        </GPH>
        <BILCOD>BILLING CODE 4910-13-C</BILCOD>

        <P>FAA has, therefore, determined that this is not a “significant regulatory action” as defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and is not “significant” as defined in DOT's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulatory Flexibility Determination</HD>
        <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) (RFA) establishes “as a principle of regulatory issuance that agencies shall endeavor, consistent with the objectives of the rule and of applicable statutes, to fit regulatory and informational requirements to the scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation. To achieve this principle, agencies are required to solicit and consider flexible regulatory proposals and to explain the rationale for their actions to assure that such proposals are given serious consideration.” The RFA covers a wide range of small entities, including small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Agencies must perform a review to determine whether a rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If the agency determines that it will, the agency must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis as described in the RFA.</P>
        <P>However, if an agency determines that a rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, section 605(b) of the RFA provides that the head of the agency may so certify and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The certification must include a statement providing the factual basis for this determination, and the reasoning should be clear.</P>
        <P>This final rule will help extend the careers of experienced air traffic controllers and thus have no impact on private sector entities. Consequently, the FAA certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">International Trade Impact Assessment</HD>
        <P>The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39), as amended by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Pub. L. 103-465), prohibits Federal agencies from establishing standards or engaging in related activities that create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States. Pursuant to these Acts, the establishment of standards is not considered an unnecessary obstacle to the foreign commerce of the United States, so long as the standard has a legitimate domestic objective, such as the protection of safety, and does not operate in a manner that excludes imports that meet this objective. The statute also requires consideration of international standards and, where appropriate, that they be the basis for U.S. standards. The FAA has assessed the potential effect of this final rule and determined that it will not affect imports as it will have only a domestic impact and therefore is not subject to these Acts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Unfunded Mandates Assessment</HD>
        <P>Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) requires each Federal agency to prepare a written statement assessing the effects of any Federal mandate in a proposed or final agency rule that may result in an expenditure of $100 million or more (in 1995 dollars) in any one year by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector; such a mandate is deemed to be a “significant regulatory action.” The FAA currently uses an inflation-adjusted value of $143.1 million in lieu of $100 million. This rule does not contain such a mandate; therefore, the requirements of Title II of the Act do not apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13132, Federalism</HD>
        <P>The FAA has analyzed this final rule under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 13132, Federalism. We determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, and, therefore, does not have federalism implications.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulations Affecting Intrastate Aviation in Alaska</HD>
        <P>Section 1205 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3213) requires the FAA, when modifying its regulations in a manner affecting intrastate aviation in Alaska, to consider the extent to which Alaska is not served by transportation modes other than aviation, and to establish appropriate regulatory distinctions. In the NPRM, we requested comments on whether the proposed rule should apply differently to intrastate operations in Alaska. We did not receive any comments, and we have determined, based on the administrative record of this rulemaking, that there is no need to make any regulatory distinctions applicable to intrastate aviation in Alaska.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Environmental Analysis</HD>
        <P>FAA Order 1050.1E identifies FAA actions that are categorically excluded from preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. The FAA has determined this rulemaking action qualifies for the categorical exclusion identified in paragraph 312(d) and involves no extraordinary circumstances.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>The FAA has analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use (May 18, 2001). We have determined that it is not a “significant regulatory action” under the executive order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866, and DOT's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy.</P>

        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to<PRTPAGE P="13"/>comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) because the Captain of the Port Honolulu (COTP) did not become aware of the need for this temporary security zone in a timely manner to publish and seek comments on a proposed rule and consider those comments before issuing a rule that would be enforceable by December 21, 2010. Publishing an NPRM and delaying the effective date would be contrary to the public interest since the occasion would occur before a notice-and-comment rulemaking could be completed, thereby jeopardizing the safety of the President of the United States, members of his official party, and other senior government officials. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The COTP finds that this temporary security zone needs to be effective by December 21, 2010, to ensure the safety of the President of the United States, members of his official party, and senior government officials visiting the Kailua Bay area on the eastern coast of Oahu, Hawaii.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Purpose</HD>
        <P>From December 21, 2010 through January 5, 2011, the President of the United States, members of his official party, and senior government officials will be residing near the Kailua Bay shoreline on Oahu, Hawaii. This position is located adjacent to U.S. navigable waters in the Honolulu Captain of the Port Zone. The Coast Guard is establishing this security zone to ensure the safety of the President of the United States, members of his official party, and senior government officials.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion of Rule</HD>

        <P>This temporary security zone is effective from 10 a.m. HST on December 21, 2010 through 8 p.m. HST on January 5, 2011. It is located within the Honolulu Captain of the Port Zone (<E T="03">See</E>33 CFR 3.70-10) and covers all U.S. navigable waters in the Kailua Bay on the west side of a line connecting Kapoho Point and continuing at a bearing of 222° True to Namala Place Road; as well as the nearby channel from its entrance at Kapoho Point to a point 150 yards along the channel to the southwest of the N. Kalaheo Avenue Road Bridge. This zone extends from the surface of the water to the ocean floor. This zone will include the navigable waters of the channel beginning at point 21°25.6′ N, 157°45′ W, then extending the channel way to 21°25.6′ N, 157°44.6′ W, then all the waters extending to 21°25.5′ N, 157°44.4′ W (Kapoho Point) with all the waters to the west of a straight line to 21°25′ N, 157°44.6′ W (Namala Place), and then extending back to the original point 21°25′ N, 157°45′ W. Additionally, three (3) yellow buoys will be placed in proximity of the security zone along the east coastline and one (1) yellow buoy will be placed as visual aids for mariners and the public to approximate the zone.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the general regulations in 33 CFR part 165, subpart D, no person or vessel will be permitted to transit into or remain in the zone except for authorized support vessels, aircraft and support personnel, or other vessels authorized by the Captain of the Port or the District Commander. Any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer, and any other Captain of the Port representative permitted by law, may enforce the zone. Vessels, aircraft, or persons in violation of this rule would be subject to the penalties set forth in 33 U.S.C. 1232 and 50 U.S.C. 192.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Analyses</HD>
        <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on 13 of these statutes or executive orders.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under the regulatory policies and procedures of DHS is unnecessary. This expectation is based on the limited duration of the zone, the limited geographic area affected by it, and that the general public will be permitted to transit the security zone as necessary but will not be permitted to loiter.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.</P>

        <P>The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We expect that there will be little to no impact to small entities due to the narrow scope, nature of this security zone, and that the general public will be permitted to transit the security zone as necessary but will not be permitted to loiter. Additionally, before and during the effective period, the Coast Guard will issue verbal maritime advisories, and distribute a written notice to waterway users and online at<E T="03">http://homeport.uscg.mil/honolulu.</E>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Assistance for Small Entities</HD>
        <P>Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.</P>
        <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Collection of Information</HD>
        <P>This rule calls for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Federalism</HD>

        <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it does not have implications for federalism.<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
        <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or Tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>

        <P>This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Protection of Children</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may disproportionately affect children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
        <P>This rule does not have Tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Energy Effects</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a “significant energy action” under that order because it is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not designated it as a significant energy action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Technical Standards</HD>

        <P>The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in their regulatory activities unless the agency provides Congress, through the Office of Management and Budget, with an explanation of why using these standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>specifications of materials, performance, design, or operation; test methods; sampling procedures; and related management systems practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.</P>
        <P>This rule does not use technical standards. Therefore, we did not consider the use of voluntary consensus standards.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Environment</HD>
        <P>We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Management Directive 5100.1 and Commandant Instruction M16475.1D, which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370f), and have concluded under the Instruction that there are no factors in this case that would limit the use of a categorical exclusion under section 2.B.2 of the Instruction. Therefore, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(g) of the Commandant Instruction M16475.1D, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation because implementation of this security zone will not result in any: (1) Significant cumulative impacts on the human environment, (2) substantial controversy or substantial change to existing environmental conditions, (3) impacts which are more than minimal on properties under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, or (4) inconsistencies with any Federal, State, local laws or administrative determinations relating to the environment.</P>

          <P>EPA is approving portions of four revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) that create and amend the Emissions Banking and Trading of Allowances (EBTA) Program. The EBTA Program establishes a cap and trade program to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<E T="52">X</E>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>) from participating electric generating facilities. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) originally submitted the EBTA program to EPA as a SIP revision on January 3, 2000. Since that time, the TCEQ has submitted SIP revisions for the EBTA Program on September 11, 2000; July 15, 2002; and October 24, 2006. EPA has determined that these changes to the Texas SIP comply with the Federal Clean Air Act (the Act or CAA) and EPA regulations, are consistent with EPA policies, and will improve air quality. This action is being taken under section 110 and parts C and D of the Act.</P>

        <P>We are fully approving severable portions of four revisions to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) that create and amend the Emissions Banking and Trading of Allowances (EBTA) Program. The EBTA Program establishes a cap and trade program to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<E T="52">X</E>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>) from participating electric generating facilities. The TCEQ originally submitted the EBTA program to EPA as a SIP revision on January 3, 2000. Since that time, the TCEQ has submitted SIP revisions for the EBTA Program on September 11, 2000; July 15, 2002; and October 24, 2006.</P>
        <P>EPA acted on the above SIP revisions through a direct final rulemaking and accompanying proposed rule action on November 16, 2010, at 75 FR 69884 and 75 FR 69909, respectively. In our direct final action we stated that we would withdraw our direct final approval if we received relevant adverse comments before December 16, 2010. Because EPA received one adverse comment, we withdrew our direct final action on December 15, 2010. As we discussed in our direct final and proposed rulemaking actions, we are proceeding with a final action and responding to the comments received in this notice. Today, we are approving the EBTA program and subsequent revisions as we proposed and find that they comply with the CAA and EPA regulations, are consistent with EPA policies, and will improve air quality. This final approval is being taken under parts C and D of the CAA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. What is the background for this action?</HD>

        <P>The TCEQ created the EBTA Program to implement the requirements of Texas Senate Bill 7 (SB 7), from the 76th Legislature, 1999, which deregulated the electric utility industry. Under Texas SB 7, TCEQ was required to develop a permitting system and a mass cap and trade system to distribute allowances for use by electric generating facilities. The EBTA program is designed to achieve a 50 percent reduction in NO<E T="52">X</E>emissions and a 25 percent reduction in SO<E T="52">2</E>emissions, both based on 1997 heat input data, from participating sources. EPA has taken separate action on the permitting system required under Texas SB 7 and established at 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter I (<E T="03">See</E>docket EPA-R06-OAR-2005-TX-0031).</P>

        <P>In our November 16, 2010, direct final action, we presented our evaluation of the EBTA program. Generally, SIP rules must be enforceable and must not relax existing requirements.<E T="03">See</E>Clean Air Act sections 110(a), 110(l), and 193. EPA's review of the January 3, 2000; September 11, 2000; July 15, 2002; and October 24, 2006 SIP revisions finds that all 4 SIP submittals are consistent with the requirements at 40 CFR Part 51 and are considered complete SIP submittals in accordance with 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix V. This detailed analysis is available in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for this rulemaking. Additionally, we reviewed the EBTA program with respect to EPA's<PRTPAGE P="16"/>Economic Incentive Program (EIP) Guidance “Improving Air Quality with Economic Incentive Programs” (EPA-452/R-01-001, January 2001) (EIP Guidance). Our analysis, as detailed in the TSD accompanying this rulemaking, finds that the EBTA program is consistent with the criteria for discretionary source specific emissions cap programs. The EBTA program will provide compliance flexibility to participating electric generating facilities in Texas and achieve the programmatic emission reduction goals of Texas SB 7. Further, EPA finds that the EBTA program is consistent with section 110(l) of the CAA and will not interfere with any applicable requirements concerning attainment and reasonable further progress towards attainment of the NAAQS or any other applicable requirements of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. What are EPA's responses to comments received on the proposed action?</HD>
        <P>EPA received one adverse comment on our proposed action, available in the docket. As discussed previously, because we received an adverse comment within the comment period, EPA withdrew our direct final rulemaking on December 15, 2010. We are proceeding with a separate final action on the EBTA program in this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment 1:</E>The comment EPA received states in its entirety: “No cap and trade other than through Congress!”</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Response 1:</E>The commenter did not provide any basis for why cap and trade should only be done through Congress or provide any specific comment on the EBTA program. There is nothing in the comment that convinces EPA that the EBTA program should not be approved. The Clean Air Act was enacted by Congress. 42 U.S.C.A. 7401. Under the Act, EPA is authorized to set clean air standards. 42 U.S.C.A. 7409. States are authorized to choose control strategies to meet these standards. 42 U.S.C.A. 7410(a). EPA can approve the strategies into State implementation plans, as long as the strategies are consistent with the Act. 42 U.S.C.A. 7410(l). As we stated in our proposal, and in section II of this notice, EPA finds the EBTA program to be consistent with the Act. EPA is making no changes to our proposed action as a result of this comment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
        <P>Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:</P>
        <P>• Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);</P>

        <P>• Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

        <P>• Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
        <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</P>
        <P>• Does not have Federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
        <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
        <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</P>
        <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act; and</P>
        <P>• Does not provide EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</P>
        <P>In addition, this rule does not have Tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because the SIP is not approved to apply in Indian country located in the State, and EPA notes that it will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law.</P>
        <P>The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801<E T="03">et seq.,</E>as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>

        <P>Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 4, 2011. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (<E T="03">See</E>section 307(b)(2).)</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) makes the final determinations listed below of the modified BFEs for each community listed. These modified BFEs have been published in newspapers of local circulation and ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Deputy Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administrator has resolved any appeals resulting from this notification.</P>
        <P>The modified BFEs are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this final rule includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified BFEs determinations are available for inspection.</P>

        <P>The modified BFEs are made pursuant to section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001<E T="03">et seq.,</E>and with 44 CFR part 65.</P>
        <P>For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.</P>
        <P>The modified BFEs are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</P>

        <P>These modified BFEs, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain<PRTPAGE P="18"/>management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.</P>
        <P>These modified BFEs are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and also are used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made final, and for the contents in those buildings. The changes in BFEs are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E>This final rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. An environmental impact assessment has not been prepared.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Flexibility Act.</E>As flood elevation determinations are not within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Regulatory Classification.</E>This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Executive Order 13132, Federalism.</E>This final rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132, Federalism.</P>

          <P>From the date of the second publication of these changes in a newspaper of local circulation, any person has ninety (90) days in which to request through the community that the Deputy Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administrator reconsider the changes.

        <P>The modified BFEs are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified BFE determinations are available for inspection is provided.</P>
        <P>Any request for reconsideration must be based on knowledge of changed conditions or new scientific or technical data.</P>

        <P>The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001<E T="03">et seq.,</E>and with 44 CFR part 65.</P>
        <P>For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.</P>
        <P>The modified BFEs are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</P>
        <P>These modified BFEs, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. The changes in BFEs are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.</P>

        <P>NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR parts 600 and 679.</P>
        <P>The 2010 Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) in the BSAI is 168,780 metric tons (mt) as established by the final 2010 and 2011 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010). Pursuant to § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A), the allocations of the Pacific cod TAC are 73,000 mt to hook-and-line catcher/processors, 2,248 mt to pot catcher/processors, 300 mt to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 meters (m)) length overall (LOA) using hook-and-line gear, 12,591 mt to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using pot gear, and 3,319 mt to the Amendment 80 limited access sector. The allocation to American Fisheries Act (AFA) trawl catcher/processors is 4,067 mt after one reallocation on September 9, 2010 (75 FR 55690, September 14, 2010). The allocation to catcher vessels using trawl gear is 28,809 mt after two reallocations on August 27, 2010 (75 FR 52478, August 26, 2010) and September 9, 2010 (75 FR 55690, September 14, 2010). The allocation to jig gear is 510 mt after two reallocations on March 17, 2010 (75 FR 13444, March 22, 2010) and April 12, 2010 (75 FR 19562, April 15, 2010). The allocation to catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line or pot gear is 5,098 after three reallocations on March 17, 2010 (75 FR 13444, March 22, 2010), April 12, 2010 (75 FR 19562, April 15, 2010), and August 27, 2010 (75 FR 52478, August 26, 2010).</P>
        <P>First, as of December 23, 2010, the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Administrator), has determined that vessels using jig gear will not be able to harvest 160 mt of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under § 679.20(a)(7)(ii) and subsequent reallocations. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.20(a)(7)(iii)(A), NMFS apportions 160 mt of Pacific cod from vessels using jig gear to catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line or pot gear.</P>
        <P>Second, as of December 23, 2010, the Regional Administrator has determined that catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line gear will not be able to harvest 299 mt of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A). Therefore, in accordance with § 679.20(a)(7)(iii)(A), NMFS apportions 251 mt of Pacific cod from catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line gear to catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line or pot gear and 48 mt of Pacific cod from catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line gear to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using pot gear.</P>
        <P>Third, as of December 23, 2010, the Regional Administrator has determined that AFA trawl catcher/processors will not be able to harvest 26 mt of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under  § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A) and subsequent reallocations. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.20(a)(7)(iii)(B), NMFS apportions 26 mt of Pacific cod from AFA trawl catcher/processors to the Amendment 80 limited access sector.</P>
        <P>Fourth, as of December 23, 2010, the Regional Administrator has determined that trawl catcher vessels will not be able to harvest 634 mt of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A) and subsequent reallocations. The Regional Administrator has also determined that the projected unharvested amount is unlikely to be harvested by any of the other catcher vessel sectors described in § 679.20(a)(7)(iii)(A). Therefore, in accordance with § 679.20(a)(7)(iii)(B), NMFS apportions 405 mt of Pacific cod from trawl catcher vessels to the Amendment 80 limited access sector, 190 mt of Pacific cod from trawl catcher vessels to hook-and-line catcher/processors, 33 mt to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using pot gear, and 6 mt to pot catcher/processors.</P>
        <P>Finally, as of December 23, 2010, the Regional Administrator has determined that catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using pot gear will not be able to harvest 1,096 mt of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under § 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A) and subsequent reallocations. Therefore, in accordance with § 679.20(a)(7)(iii)(C), NMFS apportions 1,096 mt of Pacific cod from catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using pot gear to pot catcher/processors.</P>
        <P>The allocations for Pacific cod specified in the final 2010 and 2011 final harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (75 FR 11778, March 12, 2010) and reallocations on March 17, 2010 (75 FR 13444, March 22, 2010), April 12, 2010 (75 FR 19562, April 15, 2010), August 27, 2010 (75 FR 52478, August 26, 2010), and September 9, 2010 (75 FR 55690, September 14, 2010) are revised as follows: 4,041 mt to AFA catcher/processors using trawl gear, 3,750 mt to the Amendment 80 limited access sector, 28,175 mt to catcher vessels using trawl gear, 1 mt to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line gear, 11,576 mt to catcher vessels greater than or equal to 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using pot gear, 5,509 mt to catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line or pot gear, 350 mt to vessels using jig gear, 3,350 mt to pot catcher/processors, and 73,190 mt to hook-and-line catcher/processors.</P>
        <P>This will enhance the socioeconomic well-being of harvesters dependent upon Pacific cod in this area. The Regional Administrator considered the following factors in reaching this decision: (1) The current catch of Pacific cod by the applicable BSAI sectors and, (2) the harvest capacity and stated intent on future harvesting patterns of vessels in the sectors participating in this fishery.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>

        <P>This action responds to the best available information recently obtained from the fishery. The Assistant<PRTPAGE P="27"/>Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) as such requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This requirement is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as it would prevent NMFS from responding to the most recent fisheries data in a timely fashion and would delay the reallocation of Pacific cod. Since the fishery is currently open, it is important to immediately inform the industry as to the revised allocations. Immediate notification is necessary to allow for the orderly conduct and efficient operation of this fishery, to allow the industry to plan for the fishing season, and to avoid potential disruption to the fishing fleet as well as processors. NMFS was unable to publish a notice providing time for public comment because the most recent, relevant data only became available as of December 23, 2010.</P>
        <P>The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the effective date of this action under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). This finding is based upon the reasons provided above for waiver of prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</P>
        <P>This action is required by § 679.20 and is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>We are revising an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above. That NPRM proposed replacing the power control relays for the fuel boost pumps and override pumps with new relays having a ground fault interrupt (GFI) feature. That NPRM was prompted by results from fuel system reviews conducted by the manufacturer. This action revises that NPRM for all airplanes by proposing to require an electrical bonding resistance measurement for certain GFI relays to verify that certain bonding requirements are met. This action also revises that NPRM by proposing to require, for certain airplanes, an inspection to ensure that certain screws are properly installed, and re-installing longer screws if necessary. We are proposing this supplemental NPRM to prevent damage to the fuel pumps caused by electrical arcing that could introduce an ignition source in the fuel tank, which, in combination with flammable fuel vapors, could result in a fuel tank explosion and consequent loss of the airplane. Since these actions impose an additional burden over that proposed in the NPRM, we are reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.</P>

        <P>We issued an NPRM to amend 14 CFR part 39 to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Model 757-200, -200PF, -200CB, and -300 series airplanes. That NPRM was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on October 19, 2009 (74 FR 53436).

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments</HD>
        <P>We gave the public the opportunity to comment on the previous NPRM. The following presents the comments received on the NPRM and the FAA's response to each comment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Change Wording in NPRM</HD>
        <P>Boeing requested that we change the wording in the paragraph of the NPRM titled, “FAA's Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD.” The paragraph states in part: “Airworthiness Limitation (AWL) 28-AWL-21 of Section 9 of the Boeing 757 Maintenance Planning Document (MPD) Document, D622N001-9, Revision March 2008, which was required by AD 2008-10-11, is also related to this proposed AD by including a repetitive operational test of the GFI relays, and repair of any failed GFI relay to ensure continued functionality of the GFI circuit.” Boeing pointed out that AWL 28-AWL-21 does not mention repair of any failed GFI relay and requested that the phrase “and repair of any failed GFI relay” be deleted from that paragraph of the NPRM.</P>
        <P>We agree with Boeing's statement that AWL 28-AWL-21 of Section 9 of the Boeing 757 Maintenance Planning Document (MPD) Document, D622N001-9, Revision March 2008, does not describe repair of the GFI relays. The intent of the repair statement in the original NPRM was to show that if a maintenance check fails, it should be followed by a system repair and retest before pump operation. The correction can be a replacement of the GFI relay, its repair, or some other means identified in the airplane maintenance manual. However, the paragraph referenced by the commenter is not restated in this supplemental NPRM. Therefore, no change to this supplemental NPRM is necessary in this regard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request To Permit Incorporation of Universal Fault Interrupter (UFI)</HD>
        <P>TDG Aerospace requested that we change the previous NPRM to reflect incorporation of a UFI it produces as an approved means of compliance for providing electrical fault protection for the center fuel tank override boost pumps. Thomson Airways, Jet2.com, FedEx, Continental Airlines, American Airlines, and DHL support TDG Aerospace's request. TDG Aerospace stated that FAA Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) ST01950LA, issued January 17, 2007, installs the TDG Aerospace UFI on Model 757 airplanes. TDG Aerospace pointed out that the UFIs have been approved as an alternative method of compliance (AMOC) with the requirements of paragraph (g) of AD 2008-11-07, Amendment 39-15529 (73 FR 30755, May 29, 2008), and paragraph (e) of AD 2002-24-51, Amendment 39-12900 (67 FR 61253, September 30, 2002), for certain Model 757-200 and 757-300 airplanes.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge the commenter's request to allow the incorporation of the TDG Aerospace UFI for compliance with this supplemental NPRM. We will be working closely with TDG Aerospace on this issue; however, we have not yet completed evaluating the STC (STC ST01950LA) against the GFI-specific requirements of this supplemental NPRM. We issued AMOC approvals for certain requirements of ADs 2008-11-07 and 2002-24-51 in reference to potential ignition due to the generation of sparks caused by metal-to-metal contact during dry fuel pump operation, rather than generation by electrical arcing that this supplemental NPRM addresses. If substantiating data demonstrate that the TDG Aerospace UFI will provide an acceptable level of safety, we might consider reflecting incorporation of the STC as an option when we issue the final rule AD. We have not changed the supplemental NPRM in this regard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request Use of Substitutes for Common Hardware</HD>
        <P>American Airlines requested that operators be allowed to use substitutes for common hardware such as washers, nuts, bolts, shims, sealants, and adhesives that have been determined to be equivalent to the operator's parts management system. American Airlines stated that the Parts Disposition Authority for American Airlines is contained in the engineering procedures manual (EPM), which is incorporated by reference into the general manual that is required by the FAA-approved operations specification. The commenter stated that the EPM defines the process by which parts equivalency can be established. American Airlines stated that using approved substitutes for common hardware will eliminate unnecessary AMOC requests for equivalent hardware.</P>
        <P>We disagree with the request to allow the use of substitutes for common hardware. Common hardware, as detailed above, in certain cases may play an integral role in the safety and integrity of the installation. The specific importance of common hardware may not always be obvious, and parts equivalency can only be assessed and addressed by an engineering review of the system and its installation. Operators may use the approved fastener and process material substitutions listed in the Accomplishment Instructions of Boeing Service Bulletins 757-28A0078 and 757-28A0079, both Revision 1, both dated August 24, 2010, as applicable. According to the provisions of paragraph (k) of this AD, operators may request approval of an AMOC to use substitutes for common hardware, if the request is submitted with substantiating data that demonstrate the substitutes for common hardware will provide an acceptable level of safety. We have not changed the supplemental NPRM in this regard.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Changes Made to This Supplemental NPRM</HD>
        <P>We have revised this supplemental NPRM to identify the legal name of the manufacturer as published in the most recent type certificate data sheet for the affected airplane models.</P>
        <P>Since issuance of the original NPRM, we have increased the labor rate used in the Costs of Compliance from $80 per work-hour to $85 per work-hour. The Costs of Compliance information, below, reflects this increase in the specified hourly rate.</P>
        <P>We have also revised the Costs of Compliance in this supplemental NPRM to include the cost of the inspection to ensure that the installation screws used to secure the GFI relays have enough grip length to hold the screws to each nutplate and the cost of the bonding resistance measurement.</P>

        <P>We have been advised that there is an error in Boeing Service Bulletins 757-28A0078 and 757-28A0079, both Revision 1, both dated August 24, 2010. The note in paragraph 3.B.12.i(5), refers to the left override fuel boost pump instead of the right override fuel boost pump. Boeing has issued Service Bulletin Information Notices (IN) 757-28A0078 IN 02 and 757-28A0079 IN 02, both dated October 6, 2010, to inform operators of the error. We have added a new paragraph (i) to this supplemental NPRM to reflect this change.<PRTPAGE P="30"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination</HD>
        <P>We are proposing this supplemental NPRM because we evaluated all the relevant information and determined the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design. Certain changes described above expand the scope of the original NPRM. As a result, we have determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for the public to comment on this supplemental NPRM.</P>

        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in subtitle VII, part A, subpart III, section 44701: “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
        <P>(2) Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979),</P>
        <P>(3) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>

          <P>We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above. This proposed AD would require replacing the existing unshielded fuel quantity indication system (FQIS) wire bundles with double shielded FQIS wire bundles, installing a new wire feed-through fitting, and grounding the wire shields, as applicable; and doing repetitive low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspections for cracking of the fuselage skin, and corrective actions if necessary. This proposed AD also would require revising the maintenance program to incorporate certain airworthiness limitations. This proposed AD was prompted by fuel system reviews conducted by the manufacturer. We are proposing this AD to increase the level of protection from lightning strikes and prevent the potential of ignition sources inside fuel tanks, which, in combination with flammable fuel vapors, could result in fuel tank explosions and consequent loss of the airplane.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>The FAA has examined the underlying safety issues involved in fuel tank explosions on several large transport airplanes, including the adequacy of existing regulations, the service history of airplanes subject to those regulations, and existing maintenance practices for fuel tank systems. As a result of those findings, we issued a regulation titled “Transport Airplane Fuel Tank System Design Review, Flammability Reduction and Maintenance and Inspection Requirements” (66 FR 23086, May 7, 2001). In addition to new airworthiness standards for transport airplanes and new maintenance requirements, this rule included Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 88 (“SFAR 88,” Amendment 21-78, and subsequent Amendments 21-82 and 21-83).</P>
        <P>Among other actions, SFAR 88 requires certain type design (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>type certificate (TC) and supplemental type certificate (STC)) holders to substantiate that their fuel tank systems can prevent ignition sources in the fuel tanks. This requirement applies to type design holders for large turbine-powered transport airplanes and for subsequent modifications to those airplanes. It requires them to perform design reviews and to develop design changes and maintenance procedures if their designs do not meet the new fuel tank safety standards. As explained in the preamble to the rule, we intended to adopt airworthiness directives to mandate any changes found necessary to address unsafe conditions identified as a result of these reviews.</P>
        <P>In evaluating these design reviews, we have established four criteria intended to define the unsafe conditions associated with fuel tank systems that require corrective actions. The percentage of operating time during which fuel tanks are exposed to flammable conditions is one of these criteria. The other three criteria address the failure types under evaluation: Single failures, single failures in combination with a latent condition(s), and in-service failure experience. For all four criteria, the evaluations included consideration of previous actions taken that may mitigate the need for further action.</P>
        <P>We have determined that the actions identified in this AD are necessary to reduce the potential of ignition sources inside fuel tanks, which, in combination with flammable fuel vapors, could result in fuel tank explosions and consequent loss of the airplane.</P>
        <P>A safety assessment has determined that shielding was not provided for the FQIS wire bundles. Unshielded wire bundles could result in a reduced level of protection against a lightning strike which could be a potential ignition source for the fumes in the fuel tanks. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fuel tank explosions and consequent loss of the airplane.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>We reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 727-28-0131, dated August 18, 2010. The service information describes procedures for the following:</P>
        <P>• For airplanes in Groups 1, 12, 13, and 14: Replacing the FQIS wire bundles between the fitting and ground brackets at the pressure seal and the tank connectors on the wing tanks with double shielded wire bundles; installing a new wire feed-through fitting and ground brackets for the wires at the pressure seal, and ground brackets at the wing tank connectors; and grounding the wire shields at the pressure seal feed-through fitting and ground brackets and at the tank connector brackets.</P>
        <P>• For airplanes in Groups 2 through 11 and 15 through 49: Replacing the FQIS wire bundles between the pressure seal and the volumetric top-off (VTO) connectors with double shielded wire bundles and working the ground wires at the VTO connectors.</P>
        <P>• For all airplanes: Doing repetitive LFEC inspections for cracking in the fuselage skin on the left and right sides of the airplane, and contacting Boeing for repair instructions and doing the repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>We have also reviewed Section 9 of the Boeing 727-100/200 Airworthiness Limitations (AWLs), D6-8766-AWL, Revision August 2010. Sub-Section D of Section 9 of the Boeing 727-100/200 Airworthiness Limitations (AWLs), D6-8766-AWL describes AWLs for fuel tank systems, including the following fuel system AWLs:</P>
        <P>• AWL No. 28-AWL-18 which is a check of the fuel quantity indicating system (FQIS)—out-tank wiring lightning shield to ground termination, applicable to all Model 727-100 and -200 airplanes that have incorporated Boeing Service Bulletin 727-28-0131.</P>

        <P>• AWL No. 28-AWL-19 which is a critical design configuration control limitation (CDCCL) that specifies to do a check of the FQIS—out-tank wiring lightning shield to ground termination, following any FQIS out-tank wire bundle replacement, wire bundle shield repair or shield path to ground reconnection, applicable to all Model 727-100 and -200 airplanes that have incorporated Boeing Service Bulletin 727-28-0131.<PRTPAGE P="33"/>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination</HD>
        <P>We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all the relevant information and determined the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed AD Requirements</HD>
        <P>This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified in the service information described previously, except as discussed under “Differences Between Proposed Rule and Service Bulletin.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between Proposed Rule and Service Bulletin</HD>
        <P>Although Boeing Service Bulletin 727-28-0131, dated August 18, 2010, specifies that operators may contact the manufacturer for disposition of certain repair conditions, this proposed AD would require operators to repair those cracks using a method approved by the FAA.</P>

        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in subtitle VII, part A, subpart III, section 44701: “General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
        <P>(2) Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979),</P>
        <P>(3) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>
        <P>(4) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>On December 8, 1998, we issued AD 98-26-01, Amendment 39-10942 (63 FR 69179, December 16, 1998). That AD required actions intended to address an unsafe condition on the products listed above.</P>
        <P>Since we issued AD 98-26-01, we have determined that certain compliance times need to be reduced in order to adequately address the identified unsafe condition. Therefore, certain requirements of paragraphs (h), (i), (j), (m), (n), and (s) of that AD are included in this NPRM. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Community, has issued EASA Airworthiness Directive 2007-0242, dated September 4, 2007 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>DGAC [Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile] France Airworthiness Directive (AD) 1992-106-132(B) original issue up to revision 7 was issued to require a set of inspection- and modification tasks which addressed JAR/FAR [Joint Aviation Regulation/Federal Aviation Regulation] 25-571 requirements related to damage-tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure [FAA AD 98-26-01 corresponds to DGAC AD 1992-106-132(B)R4, dated June 5, 1996].</P>
          <P>Following the Extended Design Service Goal activities as part of the Structure Task Group for the Airbus A310 program, EASA issued AD 2007-0053 which replaced DGAC France AD F-1992-106-132R7. Since the issuance of that AD, the thresholds and the intervals of some Airbus Service Bulletins (SBs which address structure fatigue related areas on the wing parts), until now part of the requirements of AD 2007-0053, have been updated.</P>
          <P>For the reasons stated above, this new [EASA] AD requires the accomplishment of the structural fatigue-related corrective actions in accordance with the latest revision of these SBs which have been reviewed in the context of the A310 Extended Service Goal activities. Consequently, this new AD supersedes the requirements of paragraphs 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.13, 1.18 of EASA AD 2007-0053, which has been revised accordingly.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>The unsafe condition is reduced structural integrity of the wings. The required actions are as follows, depending on airplane configuration:</FP>
        <P>• For certain Model A310-203 and A310-222 airplanes: Repetitive detailed inspections for cracking of the leading edge access panels around the bolt holes, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• For certain Model A310-203, A310-204, A310-222, A310-304, A310-322, A310-324, and A310-325 airplanes: Repetitive eddy current inspections to detect cracks in the holes around the overwing refueling aperture at ribs 13-14, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• For certain Model A310-203, A310-204, A310-222, A310-304, A310-322, A310-324, and A310-325 airplanes: Repetitive external detailed inspections for cracking of the top skin at ribs 13-14, repetitive internal detailed inspections for cracking of stringer 7 and stringer 8 of the overwing refuel aperture, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• For certain Model A310-203 and A310-222 airplanes: Repetitive detailed inspections for cracking around the bolts in the wing top skin upper surface of the front spar between rib 7 and rib 28, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• For certain Model A310-203 and A310-222 airplanes: Repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) or X-ray inspections to detect cracking of the stringer runouts inboard and outboard of rib 14 at stringers 6, 7, 8, and 9, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• For certain Model A310-203, A310-204, A310-222, A310-304, A310A-322, and A310-324 airplanes: Repetitive ultrasonic inspections for cracking in certain bolt holes where the main landing gear forward pick-up fitting is attached to the rear spar, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>You may obtain further information by examining the MCAI in the AD docket.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Other Relevant Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>On September 5, 1990, we issued AD 90-19-07, Amendment 39-6731 (55 FR 37455), for certain Airbus Model A310-200 series airplanes, to require repetitive X-ray inspections of stringers 6, 7, 8, and 9 run-outs inboard and outboard of rib 14, and repair if necessary. Accomplishing an inspection in accordance with paragraph (l) of this AD would terminate the requirements of paragraph (a) of AD 90-19-07.</P>
        <P>On March 6, 1991, we issued AD 91-06-18, amendment 39-6940 (56 FR 10796), for all Airbus Model A310-200 series airplanes, to require repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) rototest inspections to detect cracks in the wing rear spar at certain bolt holes where the main landing gear (MLG) forward pick-up fittings are attached to the rear spar, and repair, if necessary. Accomplishing an inspection in accordance with paragraph (q) of this AD would terminate the requirements of AD 91-06-18, amendment 39-6940.</P>
        <P>We are also considering issuing three other NPRMs related to this NPRM:</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Directorate Identifier 2010-NM-092-AD.</E>That NPRM proposes to supersede AD 98-26-01, amendment 39-10942 (63 FR 69179, December 16, 1998), to continue to require certain actions specified in that AD. However, that NPRM does not restate paragraphs (h), (i), (j), (m), (n), and (s) of AD 98-26-01. Instead, certain requirements of paragraphs (h), (i), (j), (m), (n), and (s) of that AD are included in this NPRM, Directorate Identifier 2010-NM-091-AD.</P>
        <P>•<E T="03">Directorate Identifiers 2010-NM-089-AD and 2010-NM-090-AD.</E>Both of these NPRMs include the requirements of certain other paragraphs of AD 98-26-01.</P>

        <P>The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with the State of Design Authority, we have been notified of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a NOTE within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>Based on the service information, we estimate that this proposed AD would affect about 44 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it would take about 97 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this proposed AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $362,780, or $8,245 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

          <P>We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above that would supersede two existing ADs. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion</HD>
        <P>On December 8, 1998, we issued AD 98-26-01, Amendment 39-10942 (63 FR 69179, December 16, 1998); and on May 30, 1991, we issued AD 91-13-01, Amendment 39-7032 (56 FR 26602, June 10, 1991). Those ADs required actions intended to address an unsafe condition on the products listed above.</P>
        <P>Since we issued ADs 98-26-01 and 91-13-01, we have determined that certain compliance times need to be reduced in order to adequately address the identified unsafe condition. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Community, has issued EASA Airworthiness Directive 2007-0053R3, dated December 17, 2009 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>DGAC [Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile] France AD 1992-106-132(B) original issue up to revision 7 has been issued in order to mandate a set of inspections/modifications which address JAR/FAR [Joint Aviation Regulation/Federal Aviation Regulation] 25-571 requirements related to damage-tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure [FAA AD 98-26-01 corresponds to DGAC AD 1992-106-132(B)R4, dated June 5, 1996].</P>
          <P>Following the Extended Design Service Goal activities part of the Structure Task Group for the A310 program, EASA AD 2007-0053 superseded DGAC France AD F-1992-106-132R7 in order to take into account the publication of Airbus Service Bulletins (SB) A310-55-2004 at Revision 5 and Airbus SB A310-53-2074 at Revision 3, whose inspection thresholds and/or intervals had been reduced.</P>

          <P>Revision 1 of this AD was issued to remove the mandatory requirements related to the wings (<E T="03">i.e.</E>§ 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.13, and 1.18) from the Compliance section, which have been transferred to EASA AD 2007-0242.</P>
          <P>Revision 2 of this AD has been issued to remove the mandatory requirements of paragraph 1.15, 1.16 and 1.17 which have now been transferred to EASA AD 2009-0057 (§ 1.15 and 1.17) and 2009-0058 (§ 1.16) respectively.</P>
          <P>Revision 3 of this AD is issued to add a Note to the Applicability and amend the Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s) section of this AD to clarify the allowed use of the referenced SBs by operators. In addition, a note has been added to paragraph 1.7 and the notes associated to paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.12 have been clarified.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        

        <FP>The unsafe condition is reduced structural integrity of the wings, fuselage, and stabilizers. This NPRM proposes to continue to require certain actions specified in AD 98-26-01. This proposed AD also expands the inspection area of the high frequency eddy current rototest inspection<PRTPAGE P="43"/>required by paragraph (g) of AD 98-26-01. The required actions are as follows, depending on airplane configuration:</FP>
        <P>• A defectoscope or rototest inspection to detect cracks in the area of frame 47 and frame 54, install new doublers, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive visual inspections to detect cracks on frame 46 between the left- and right-hand sides of stringers 21 and 22 on the forward and aft faces, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive visual inspections to detect cracks at the T-section connecting frame 50A to the beam between the left- and right-hand sides of frames 50 and 51, and modification if necessary.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive visual inspections to detect cracks in the lower milled side panel at the lap joint with the upper side panel at frame 47 and stringer 22, left- and right-hand sides, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• An eddy current inspection to detect cracks on the upper integral part adjacent to the rear attach fittings on the horizontal stabilizer, modification of the horizontal stabilizer, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive high frequency eddy current rototest inspections for cracking of the doubler plate edge, rear spar area, and at specified fastener holes in the top skin chordwise splice along the contour of the steel doubler between ribs 3 and 4 on the left- and right-hand center and side boxes on the horizontal stabilizer, installing new fasteners if no cracking is found, and repair if necessary.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive inspections, either an eddy current or visual inspection, to detect cracks on the left and right vertical posts, numbers 1 through 5 inclusive, in the wing center box at frame 40/41, and modification if necessary.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>Airbus has issued Mandatory Service Bulletin A310-55-2004, Revision 05, including Appendix 01, dated October 13, 2006; and Airbus Service Bulletin A310-53-2019, Revision 3, dated February 28, 1991. The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with the State of Design Authority, we have been notified of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a Note within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>Based on the service information, we estimate that this proposed AD would affect about 44 products of U.S. registry.</P>
        <P>The actions that are required by AD 98-26-01 and retained in this proposed AD take about 1,087 work-hours per product, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Required parts cost about $81,973 per product. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the currently required actions is $174,368 per product.</P>
        <P>We estimate that it would take about 3 work-hours per product to comply with the new basic requirements of this proposed AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $11,220, or $255 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

          <P>We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for the products listed above. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as:</P>
          
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>A specific area, the<E T="03">lower tail plane cut-out</E>located in the tail cone is subject to an inspection programme [for cracking] * * *.</P>

        <EXTRACT>
          <PRTPAGE P="47"/>
          <P>A specific area, the<E T="03">lower tail plane cut-out</E>located in the tail cone is subject to an inspection programme specified in the Airbus Service Bulletin (SB) A310-53-2074. EASA issued AD 2007-0053 [which superseded French AD 1992-106-132 R6; French AD 1992-106-132 corresponds to FAA AD 98-26-01] to require the accomplishment of this SB at Revision 03.</P>
          <P>Airbus has established that this SB needed to be revised in order to state correct threshold and intervals due to errors introduced at revision 03. Consequently, revision 04 of this SB has been issued, and opportunity was taken:</P>
          
          <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—To clarify the inspection area and associated threshold and intervals</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—To take aeroplane utilisation into consideration, in accordance with the A310 life extension programme.</FP>
          
          <P>For the reasons stated above, this EASA AD takes over the requirements of paragraph 1.16 of EASA AD 2007-0053R1 [currently at R3], which has been revised accordingly, and requires accomplishment of the instructions contained in Airbus SB A310-53-2074 at Revision 04.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>The unsafe condition is reduced structural integrity of the tail cone. The required actions include repetitive and one-time inspections, depending on the area, of the lower tail plane cut-out, and corrective actions if necessary. The inspections include the following:</FP>
        <P>• Detailed inspections in areas 1, 2, and 3 for cracking and corrosion of the lower horizontal stabilizer cutout longeron, the corner fitting, the skin strap, and the skin.</P>
        <P>• Detailed inspections in areas 1, 2, and 3 for damaged sealant.</P>
        <P>• Eddy current inspections in area 1 for cracking.</P>
        <P>• Eddy current inspections in area 2 for cracking.</P>
        <P>• Rotating probe inspection for cracking of specified fastener holes in Area 3.</P>
        <P>The corrective actions, depending on the conditions found, include the following:</P>
        <P>• Repairing corrosion.</P>
        <P>• Contacting Airbus for repair instructions.</P>
        <P>• Replacing damaged sealant.</P>
        <P>• Removing cracking.</P>
        <P>• Doing an eddy current inspection for cracking of the reworked area.</P>
        <P>• Installing a new corner fitting.</P>
        <P>• Doing a rotating probe inspection for cracking of fastener holes.</P>
        <P>• Doing an eddy current inspection of the longeron and outer skin.</P>
        <P>• Drilling or reaming fastener holes.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Other Relevant Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>We are considering issuing three other NPRMs related to this NPRM:</P>
        <P>• Directorate Identifier 2010-NM-092-AD. That NPRM proposes to supersede AD 98-26-01, amendment 39-10942 (63 FR 69179, December 16, 1998), to continue to require certain actions specified in that AD. However, that NPRM does not restate paragraph (q) of AD 98-26-01. Instead, certain requirements of paragraph (q) of that AD are included in this NPRM, Directorate Identifier 2010-NM-089-AD.</P>
        <P>• Directorate Identifiers 2010-NM-090-AD and 2010-NM-091-AD. Both of these NPRMs include the requirements of certain other paragraphs of AD 98-26-01.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Relevant Service Information</HD>
        <P>Airbus has issued Mandatory Service Bulletin A310-53-2074, Revision 04, dated October 24, 2008. The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with the State of Design Authority, we have been notified of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a Note within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>Based on the service information, we estimate that this proposed AD would affect about 44 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it would take about 36 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this proposed AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $134,640, or $3,060 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

        <P>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Community, has issued EASA Airworthiness Directive 2009-0057, dated March 13, 2009 (referred to after this as “the MCAI”), to correct an unsafe condition for the specified products. The MCAI states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>DGAC [Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile] France AD 1992-106-132(B) original<PRTPAGE P="51"/>issue up to revision 7 was issued to require a set of inspection and modification tasks which addressed JAR/FAR [Joint Aviation Regulation/Federal Aviation Regulation] 25-571 requirements related to damage-tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure.</P>
          <P>Following the Extended Design Service Goal activities as part of the Structure Task Group for the Airbus A310 program, EASA published AD 2007-0053, which replaced DGAC France AD F-1992-106-132R7.</P>
          <P>Since the issuance of AD 2007-0053R1, the thresholds and the intervals of Airbus Service Bulletins (SB) A310-57-2050 and A310-57-2064 have been updated.</P>
          <P>Consequently, this new [EASA] AD takes over the requirements of paragraphs 1.15 and 1.17 of EASA AD 2007-0053R1, which has been revised accordingly * * * and requires the accomplishment of Airbus SB A310-57-2048 at revision 01.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>The unsafe condition is reduced structural integrity of the wings. The required actions are as follows, depending on airplane configuration:</FP>
        <P>• Cold working of trellis boom drainage holes.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive detailed or rotating probe inspections for cracking in the drain holes on the lower skin panel in the center wing box between frames 42 and 46 and corrective actions if necessary. Corrective actions include repairing cracking and contacting the FAA or EASA for repair and doing the repair.</P>
        <P>• Repetitive eddy current inspections for cracking of the upper corner angle fitting and the vertical tee fitting at left and right frame 40, and corrective actions if necessary. Corrective actions include repairing, replacing the internal angle fitting and contacting the FAA or EASA for repair and doing the repair.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Other Relevant Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>We are considering issuing three other NPRMs related to this NPRM:</P>

That NPRM proposes to supersede AD 98-26-01, amendment 39-10942 (63 FR 69179, December 16, 1998), to continue to require certain actions specified in that AD. However, that NPRM does not restate paragraphs (p) and (r) of AD 98-26-01. Instead, certain requirements of paragraphs (p) and (r) of that AD are included in this NPRM, Directorate Identifier 2010-NM-090-AD.</P>

        <P>The actions described in this service information are intended to correct the unsafe condition identified in the MCAI.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination and Requirements of This Proposed AD</HD>
        <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country, and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to our bilateral agreement with the State of Design Authority, we have been notified of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and service information referenced above. We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Differences Between This AD and the MCAI or Service Information</HD>
        <P>We have reviewed the MCAI and related service information and, in general, agree with their substance. But we might have found it necessary to use different words from those in the MCAI to ensure the AD is clear for U.S. operators and is enforceable. In making these changes, we do not intend to differ substantively from the information provided in the MCAI and related service information.</P>
        <P>We might also have proposed different actions in this AD from those in the MCAI in order to follow FAA policies. Any such differences are highlighted in a Note within the proposed AD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>
        <P>Based on the service information, we estimate that this proposed AD would affect about 44 products of U.S. registry. We also estimate that it would take about 137 work-hours per product to comply with the basic requirements of this proposed AD. The average labor rate is $85 per work-hour. Based on these figures, we estimate the cost of the proposed AD on U.S. operators to be $512,380, or $11,645 per product.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Authority for This Rulemaking</HD>
        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. “Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs,” describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in “Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements.” Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
        <P>We determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
        <P>1. Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866;</P>
        <P>2. Is not a “significant rule” under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and</P>
        <P>3. Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

        <P>We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with<PRTPAGE P="52"/>this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Revise the Definition of “Demonstration”</HD>

        <P>This proposed rule would revise the definition of demonstration at 36 CFR 7.96 (g)(1)(i) by eliminating the term “intent or propensity” where it appears in the definition and replace it with the term “reasonably likely.” In<E T="03">Boardley</E>v.<E T="03">Department of the Interior,</E>605 F. Supp. 2d 8 (D.D.C. 2009) the United States District Court for the District of Columbia commented on the demonstration definition for the National Capital Region under 36 CFR 7.96 (g)(1)(i). The Court commented the definition could raise problems, because it allowed NPS officials to restrict speech based on their determination that a person intended to draw a crowd with their conduct. Such a determination could easily rest on impermissible grounds, such as an official's perception that certain expression is controversial or inappropriate, which would be a content-based decision, impermissible under the First Amendment. While the NPS has not applied the regulation in such an impermissible manner, and has since issued a clarifying memorandum to preclude such a determination, this proposed rule would revise the definition of demonstration to minimize any possibility of a decision based on impermissible grounds.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Amendment of the Solicitation Regulation</HD>

        <P>This proposed rule also would amend the provision regarding soliciting, in order to be consistent with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decision in<E T="03">ISKCON of Potomac</E>v.<E T="03">Kennedy,</E>61 F.3d 949 (DC Cir. 1995).</P>
        <P>In<E T="03">ISKCON of Potomac,</E>the Court of Appeals held that the NPS's regulatory ban of soliciting, which the NPS traditionally construed as applying only to the in-person solicitation of immediate donations, was not “narrowly tailored.” The Court recognized that:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>* * *[t]he conduct of a special event within a small, well-defined permit area will have some effect on the ambiance of the Mall. But we cannot see how allowing in-person solicitations within the permit area will add to whatever adverse impact will result from the special event itself. The effects of solicitation will be confined to the permit area, and those who wish to escape them may simply steer clear of the authorized demonstration or special event. 61 F.3d at 956.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The Court also said:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Our holding allows only those individuals or groups participating in an authorized demonstration or special event to solicit donations within the confines of a restricted permit area such as that assigned to ISKCON. It does not require the NPS to let rampant panhandling go unchecked. 61 F.3d at 956.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Following the<E T="03">ISKCON of Potomac</E>decision, as an interim measure, the NPS posted a notice at its Washington, DC, National Capital Region Division of Park Programs permit office as well as in the Superintendent's Compendium of regulations for the National Mall and Memorial Parks, stating that soliciting would be allowed if it occurred within the confines of a permit area as part of a permitted ongoing activity. The soliciting regulation itself, however, also must be amended.</P>
        <P>Consistent with<E T="03">ISKCON of Potomac,</E>this proposed amendment would allow individuals or groups who are participating in a permitted demonstration or special event to solicit donations within the confines of a restricted permit area. Such soliciting is authorized only when provided for in a permit. Groups seeking to solicit donations as part of a demonstration or special event will need to describe the activities in their permit application.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule also formalizes the long-standing view that soliciting is limited to the in-person soliciting of immediate donations.</P>
        <P>This proposed rule deals with soliciting and not sales. Any attempt to offer or sell items, whether directly or by the use of deceit, is governed by the NPS sales regulation, at 36 CFR 7.96 (k), which limits items to be sold on park lands to books, newspapers, leaflets, pamphlets, buttons, and bumper stickers. As the NPS explained it its prefatory statement to its sales regulation, at 60 FR 17648 (1995),</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>* * * restricted merchandise cannot be “given away” and a “donation accepted” or one item “given away” in return for the purchase of another item; such transactions amount to sales.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Finally, it has been the NPS's long-standing application of its regulations that demonstrations and special events, whether under permit or not, are not allowed in the restricted areas at 36 CFR 7.96 (g)(3)(ii). To better ensure that everyone fully understands that demonstrations and special events, with or without a permit, are not allowed in these restricted areas, NPS proposes to amend its introductory sentence to clearly indicate that no demonstrations or special events are allowed in the designated restricted areas.</P>

          <P>The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is proposing to rescind two guidance documents addressing compensation discrimination: Interpreting Nondiscrimination Requirements of Executive Order 11246 with respect to Systemic Compensation Discrimination (Standards) and Voluntary Guidelines for Self-Evaluation of Compensation Practices for Compliance with Executive Order 11246 with respect to Systemic Compensation Discrimination (Voluntary Guidelines). OFCCP is proposing to rescind the Standards which have limited OFCCP's ability to effectively investigate, analyze and identify compensation discrimination. In so doing, OFCCP will continue to adhere to the principles of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (Title VII) in investigating compensation discrimination and will reinstitute flexibility in its use of investigative approaches and tools. OFCCP also proposes to establish procedures for investigating compensation discrimination through the traditional means of using its compliance manual, directives and other staff guidance. OFCCP is proposing to rescind the Voluntary Guidelines because they are largely unused by the Federal Government contracting community and have not been an effective enforcement strategy.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Department of Labor's OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246 which requires Federal Government contractors and subcontractors to provide equal employment opportunity through affirmative action and nondiscrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. Compensation discrimination is one form of discrimination prohibited by the Executive Order.</P>

        <P>OFCCP enforces contractors' compliance with this obligation primarily by conducting compliance evaluations. (<E T="03">See</E>41 CFR 60-1.20.) OFCCP's longstanding policy is to follow Title VII principles when conducting analyses of potential discrimination under Executive Order 11246, including compensation discrimination. Compensation discrimination may occur on an individual basis, or systemically, that is, it is widespread in an organization due to discriminatory compensation systems. OFCCP traditionally has established procedures for investigating compensation discrimination, as well as other forms of discrimination, through instructions for its compliance officers contained in the OFCCP Federal Contract Compliance Manual (FCCM), directives and other staff guidance materials.</P>

        <P>Identifying and remedying compensation discrimination has been an important part of OFCCP compliance efforts for many years. Concerns about compensation discrimination led OFCCP in Calendar Year (CY) 2000 to begin requiring contractors to submit compensation data requested in the scheduling letter at the outset of a compliance evaluation as a matter of course and as part of the data reported in a new Equal Opportunity Survey, which covered contractors were required to submit to OFCCP. (The Scheduling Letter was approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act OMB NO. 1215-0072; see 65 FR 68022, 68036 (November 13, 2000) for the notice regarding the Equal Opportunity Survey.) In CY 2000, OFCCP also began requiring contractors to proactively conduct in-depth analyses of their compensation systems to ensure that those systems were not discriminatory. (<E T="03">See</E>41 CFR 60-2.17(b)(3).)</P>

        <P>OFCCP changed its approach to investigating compensation discrimination in 2006. On June 16, 2006, OFCCP published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>two final guidance documents related to identifying compensation discrimination under Executive Order 11246 that contained interpretations of OFCCP regulations and Title VII principles: Interpreting Nondiscrimination Requirements of Executive Order 11246 with respect to Systemic Compensation Discrimination<PRTPAGE P="63"/>(Standards) and Voluntary Guidelines for Self-Evaluation of Compensation Practices for Compliance with Executive Order 11246 with respect to Systemic Compensation Discrimination (Voluntary Guidelines). (<E T="03">See</E>71 FR 35124 (June 16, 2006) for the Standards and 71 FR 35114 (June 16, 2006) for the Voluntary Guidelines.) Further, OFCCP rescinded the Equal Opportunity Survey in 2006. (<E T="03">See</E>71 FR 53032 (September 8, 2006).)</P>

        <P>The Standards set forth a new, rigid procedure for investigating and analyzing systemic compensation discrimination cases. Systemic compensation discrimination is defined as discrimination under a pattern or practice of disparate treatment. (<E T="03">See</E>71 FR at 35140.) The Standards prescribe procedures to be followed by OFCCP compliance officers when conducting investigations of systemic compensation discrimination in all cases, including how to group employees whose compensation is to be compared in a discrimination analysis, requiring anecdotal evidence of compensation discrimination except in unusual cases, and requiring the use of multiple regression analysis when deciding whether wage differences between groups are discriminatory. These procedures are to be followed regardless of the facts of a particular case. The rigidity of the Standards represents a significant departure from OFCCP's traditional tailoring of compensation investigation and analytical procedures to the facts of the case based on Title VII principles. Investigations of systemic compensation discrimination are complex and nuanced. During the conduct of compliance evaluations, OFCCP has traditionally focused on identifying compensation discrimination through the development of a variety of investigative and analytical tools. The use of a particular tool, or combination of tools, depends upon the facts of a specific case, and includes consulting with labor economists and other experts, as appropriate.</P>

        <P>The Standards also significantly limit OFCCP's ability to identify compensation discrimination by imposing overly narrow investigation procedures that go beyond what would be required under Title VII principles in litigation. For example, the Standards state that, except in unusual cases, OFCCP will not issue a notice of violation (NOV) without providing anecdotal evidence to support OFCCP's statistical analysis. But under Title VII, a pattern or practice class-wide disparate treatment case may be proven by statistics.<E T="03">See, e.g., Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters</E>v.<E T="03">United States,</E>431 U.S. 324, 339-40 (1977);<E T="03">Palmer</E>v.<E T="03">Shultz,</E>815 F.2d 84, 90-91 (DC Cir. 1987).<E T="03">Cf. OFCCP</E>v.<E T="03">Greenwood Mills, Inc.,</E>No. 89-OFC-39, Decision and Order of Remand, slip op. at 14 (Sec'y of Labor Nov. 20, 1995);<E T="03">OFCCP</E>v.<E T="03">Jacksonville Shipyards,</E>89-OFC-1, Decision and Remand Order, slip op. at 5 (Sec'y of Labor May 9, 1995). Moreover, requiring anecdotal evidence is particularly problematic in compensation cases as employees often are unaware of the compensation received by co-workers and, as a result, anecdotal evidence from victims of pay discrimination may not exist.</P>
        <P>The Standard's mandate to use a multiple regression analysis to identify compensation discrimination is also overly narrow and is not required under Title VII principles. While a multiple regression analysis may be a useful tool in identifying compensation discrimination, other statistical or nonstatistical analyses may be better suited, depending on the facts of the case.</P>
        <P>In short, we now believe the Standards significantly undermine OFCCP's ability to vigorously investigate and identify compensation discrimination.</P>

        <P>The Voluntary Guidelines establish procedures that contractors can elect to use in conducting the self-analysis of their pay practices required by 41 CFR 60-2.17(b)(3). As an incentive to encourage contractors to use the analytical procedures contained in the Voluntary Guidelines, OFCCP would deem a contractor, whose self-evaluation “reasonably meets” the procedures outlined in the Voluntary Guidelines, to be in compliance with section 60-2.17(b)(3) and would coordinate OFCCP's review of the contractor's compensation practices during a compliance evaluation in the manner specified in the Voluntary Guidelines. (<E T="03">See</E>71 FR at 35122.) In OFCCP's experience since 2006, contractors have rarely utilized the analytical procedures outlined in the Voluntary Guidelines when analyzing their compensation practices under section 60-2.17(b)(3).</P>
        <P>Additionally, the analytical model set forth in the Voluntary Guidelines suffers from many of the same flaws as the investigative procedures prescribed by the Standards. For example, the Voluntary Guidelines established certain rigid numerical thresholds by which the similarly situated employee groupings are to be analyzed. OFCCP believes that for some contractors, these thresholds may be exceedingly difficult to meet.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Proposal</HD>

        <P>OFCCP proposes to rescind the Standards and the Voluntary Guidelines in their entirety. OFCCP believes it is unnecessary to issue new<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices articulating its interpretations of Title VII principles related to compensation discrimination. OFCCP will continue to follow Title VII principles in investigating and analyzing compensation discrimination and in interpreting regulations related to compensation discrimination. The agency is proposing to normalize its treatment of those cases with other types of OFCCP discrimination investigations. Once rescinded, nothing in the Standards or the Voluntary Guidelines or their preambles could be relied upon as a statement of OFCCP's interpretation of Title VII principles or OFCCP regulations.</P>
        <P>If the Standards are rescinded, OFCCP will reinstitute the practice of exercising its discretion to develop compensation discrimination investigation procedures in the same manner it develops other investigation procedures. OFCCP will continually refine those procedures to ensure that they are as effective and efficient as possible. OFCCP will develop and issue compensation investigation procedures in the same manner as procedures for investigating other forms of discrimination, for example through the FCCM, directives and staff guidance materials.</P>
        <P>As mentioned above, OFCCP has found that contractors rarely use the analytical procedure suggested in the Voluntary Guidelines for conducting the compensation analyses required by section 60-2.17(b)(3). In the few instances when contractors have conducted their compensation analysis in the manner suggested in the Voluntary Guidelines, the coordination procedures of the Voluntary Guidelines have not proved to be an efficient method for verifying that the contractor's compensation system is not discriminatory. The agency has concluded that the Voluntary Guidelines have not proved to be either an effective vehicle for providing guidance about how to conduct the analyses required by section 60-2.17(b)(3) or an effective incentive for contractors to conduct the analysis in the manner described in the Voluntary Guidelines.</P>

        <P>In the absence of the Voluntary Guidelines, contractors will still be obligated to conduct self-evaluations of compensation practices as required by 41 CFR 60-2.17(b)(3). OFCCP will continue to provide any needed compliance assistance on section 60-<PRTPAGE P="64"/>2.17(b)(3) through various means, including webinars and the Web site distribution of Frequently Asked Questions as appropriate, rather than through the issuance of a<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice.</P>
        <P>OFCCP invites any interested party to comment on the proposal to rescind the Standards and the Voluntary Guidelines.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>
          <P>To carry out a 2008 Congressional rulemaking mandate, FRA is proposing to create regulations prescribing minimum safety and health requirements for camp cars that a railroad provides as sleeping quarters to any of its train employees, signal employees, and dispatching service employees and individuals employed to maintain its right of way. The proposed regulations would supplant existing guidelines that interpret existing statutory requirements, enacted decades earlier, that railroad-provided camp cars be clean, safe, and sanitary, and afford those employees and individuals an opportunity for rest free from the interruptions caused by noise under the control of the railroad. In further response to the rulemaking mandate, the proposed regulations would include the additional statutory requirements, enacted in 2008, that camp cars be provided with indoor toilets, potable water, and other features to protect the health of such workers.</P>
          <P>Under separate but related statutory authority, FRA is proposing to amend regulations on construction of employee sleeping quarters. In particular, FRA proposes to implement a 2008 statutory amendment that, on and after December 31, 2009, camp cars provided by a railroad as sleeping quarters exclusively for individuals employed to maintain the right of way of a railroad are within the scope of the prohibition against beginning construction or reconstruction of employee sleeping quarters near railroad switching or humping of hazardous material. FRA's existing guidelines with respect to the location, in relation to switching or humping of hazardous material, of a camp car that is occupied exclusively by individuals employed to maintain a railroad's right of way would be replaced with regulatory amendments prohibiting a railroad from positioning such a camp car in the immediate vicinity of the switching or humping of hazardous material.</P>
          <P>Finally, FRA would make conforming changes, clarify a provision on applicability, remove an existing provision on preemptive effect as unnecessary, and move, without change, an existing provision on penalties for violation of FRA regulations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Statutory, Regulatory, and Factual Background</HD>
        <P>This proposal is being issued primarily to help satisfy the requirements of section 420 of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA), Public Law 110-432, Div. A, 122 Stat. 4848, October 16, 2008 (amending a provision of the hours of service laws at 49 U.S.C. 21106). RSIA requires the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to adopt regulations no later than April 1, 2010 establishing minimum standards for “employee sleeping quarters” in the form of “camp cars” that are provided by railroads. 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1), (c). Specifically, RSIA instructs the Secretary to prescribe regulations “to implement [49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1)] to protect the safety and health of any employees and individuals employed to maintain the right of way of a railroad carrier that use camp cars. * * * ” 49 U.S.C. 21106(c). The statutory term “employee” is defined in 49 U.S.C. 21101(3) to include a train employee, a signal employee, and a dispatching service employee, who as a group are sometimes referred to as “covered service employees.” As amended through 2008, 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1) provides that such camp cars must be—</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <FP>clean, safe, and sanitary, give those employees and individuals an opportunity for rest free from the interruptions caused by<PRTPAGE P="65"/>noise under the control of the carrier, and provide indoor toilet facilities, potable water, and other features to protect the health of employees.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1). RSIA requires the Secretary to conduct this rulemaking “in coordination with the Secretary of Labor,” and to “assess the action taken by any railroad carrier to fully retrofit or replace its camp cars. * * * ” 49 U.S.C. 21106(c).</FP>
        
        <P>FRA has longstanding regulations implementing the statutory provision that prohibits railroads, effective July 8, 1976, from beginning the construction or reconstruction of railroad-provided sleeping quarters for train employees, signal employees, and dispatching service employees in an area or in the immediate vicinity of an area where railroad switching or humping of hazardous material occurs. Currently, these regulations affecting the location of sleeping quarters for covered service employees do not apply to sleeping quarters exclusively for individuals employed to maintain the right of way of a railroad.</P>
        <P>RSIA directly requires that railroads using camp cars must “fully retrofit or replace such cars in compliance with [49 U.S.C. 20106(a)]” by December 31, 2009. 49 U.S.C. 21106(b). As will be further explained below, FRA interprets 49 U.S.C. 21106(b) as applying the prohibition in 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2) against beginning construction or reconstruction of employee sleeping quarters near switching or humping operations to camp cars provided by railroads as sleeping quarters for individuals employed to maintain the railroad right of way (MOW workers) and setting a compliance date of December 31, 2009, with respect to such camp cars exclusively for MOW workers.</P>

        <P>The Secretary has delegated the responsibility to carry out his responsibilities under RSIA to the Administrator of FRA. 74 FR 26981, 26982, June 5, 2009, codified at 49 CFR 1.49(oo).<E T="03">See also</E>49 CFR 1.49(d), delegating the Secretary's authority to carry out the hours of service laws to the Administrator of FRA, and 49 U.S.C. 103.</P>

        <P>Proposed subpart E is based extensively on FRA guidelines already in place, which, in turn, were based on the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards for sanitation and temporary labor camps at 29 CFR 1910.141 and 1910.142, modified as appropriate for the railroad environment.<E T="03">See</E>FRA's Guidelines for Clean, Safe, and Sanitary Railroad Provided Camp Cars (1990 Guidelines), 55 FR 30892, July 27, 1990, codified at 49 CFR part 228, app. C.</P>
        <P>In addition, FRA has consulted with officials of the only railroad currently known to be utilizing camp cars as sleeping quarters, Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NS), to determine what actions it has taken to conform to the statutory requirements that the cars be not only clean, safe, and sanitary and provide an opportunity for rest uninterrupted by noise under the control of the railroad, but also have “indoor toilet facilities, potable water, and other features to protect the health” of employees and MOW workers and not be placed in the immediate vicinity of certain “switching or humping operations” as defined in FRA regulations at 49 CFR 228.101(c)(3). NS has assured FRA that all of its camp cars comply with statutory requirements, but its interpretation asserts that camp cars exclusively occupied by MOW workers are not subject to 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2).</P>
        <P>MOW workers have been given protection by limits of how close their sleeping quarters are to switching and hump operations. That protection formerly only applied to train employees, signal employees, and dispatching employees. In 1976, Congress required that all sleeping quarters, “including crew quarters, camp or bunk cars, and trailers,” provided by a railroad to its “employees” be “clean, safe, and sanitary” and provide an opportunity for rest without interruptions caused by noise under the control of the railroad. Public Law 94-348, sec. 4, adding subsection (a)(3) to section 2 of the Hours of Service Act, then codified at 45 U.S.C. 62(a)(3) (1976) and now codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>Again, the term “employees” included only those who, in the terminology of the present statute, are called “train employees,” “signal employees,” or “dispatching service employees,” and did not include MOW workers. In the same legislation, Congress prohibited railroads from beginning, on or after July 8, 1976, the construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters for “employees” “within or in the immediate vicinity (as determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the Secretary) of any area where railroad switching or humping operations are performed.” Public Law 94-348, sec. 4, adding subsection (a)(4) to section 2 of the Hours of Service Act, then codified at 45 U.S.C. 62(a)(4) (1976) and now codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>In the 1994 recodification of Federal transportation laws, the Hours of Service Act was simultaneously repealed, reenacted as revised, and recodified as positive law primarily in 49 U.S.C. chapter 211. Public Law 103-272, July 5, 1994.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>To carry out the 1976 statutory amendment at section 2(a)(3) of the Hours of Service Act, on July 18, 1978, FRA published interpretative guidance and a statement of policy regarding the provision requiring “clean, safe, and sanitary” sleeping quarters for employees free from railroad-controlled noise that would interrupt rest. Amendment to appendix A to 49 CFR part 228, 43 FR 30803, July 18, 1978.</P>
        <P>To carry out the 1976 amendment at section 2(a)(4) of the Hours of Service Act, on July 19, 1978, FRA published regulations codified at 49 CFR part 228, subpart C (subpart C). 43 FR 31012. As stated in the preamble to those regulations,</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>[t]he primary impetus of this amendment to the Hours of Service Act was the accident that occurred at Decatur, Illinois, on July 19, 1974. (H.R. Report No. 94-1166 (1976) at page 11.) Seven employees were killed and another 33 were injured when an explosion demolished crew quarters that were located between and adjacent to two classification yards and did other extensive damage in the middle of the Norfolk and Western yard. Three hundred sixteen persons who lived or worked in the surrounding area were also injured. The explosion resulted from accidental release of product which occurred during the switching of hazardous materials.</P>
          <P>* * *</P>
          <P>In enacting the 1976 amendment to the law, Congress determined that additional protection from accidents such as the one that occurred at Decatur, Illinois, is required for crew quarters.</P>

        <FP>43 FR 31009.</FP>
        

        <P>Subpart C defines key terms in section 2(a)(4) of the Hours of Service Act, permits railroads to request a determination by FRA that a particular proposed site is not within the “immediate vicinity,” and states the criteria by which FRA will make the determination.<E T="03">See</E>49 CFR 228.101(a). FRA approval is necessary before a railroad may begin the “construction or reconstruction” of sleeping quarters for employees within the distance of switching or humping operations specified in the regulations. 49 CFR 228.101. The distance triggering the need for approval is one-half mile “as measured from the nearest rail of the nearest trackage where switching or humping operations are performed to the point on the site where the carrier proposes to construct or reconstruct the exterior wall of the structure, or portion of such wall, which is closest to such operations.” 49 CFR 228.101(b). “Switching or humping operations” is defined to include “the classification of placarded railroad cars according to commodity or destination, assembling<PRTPAGE P="66"/>of placarded cars for train movements,  * * *  .” 49 CFR 228.101(c)(3). “Placarded car” is defined to mean “a railroad car required to be placarded by the Department of Transportation hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR 172.504).” 49 CFR 228.101(c)(4). “Construction” includes the “[p]lacement of a mobile or modular facility,” which includes placement of a camp car. 49 CFR 228.101(c)(1)(iii). On or after July 8, 1976, any railroad placing a camp car occupied by an employee near switching or humping operations must obtain FRA approval before doing so. 49 CFR 228.101(a).</P>
        <P>In 1988, Congress redefined “employee” for purpose of section 2(a)(3) of the Hours of Service Act (now codified at 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1)) so as to include MOW workers, thereby making all sleeping quarters provided by a railroad to MOW workers subject to the same statutory standard. Public Law 100-342, sec. 19(b). It should be noted, however, that the 1988 amendment did not make MOW workers “employees” for purposes of the “location” requirement at section 2(a)(4) of the Hours of Service Act. Consequently, a camp car occupied only by employees or by both employees and MOW workers is subject to subpart C, but a camp car occupied only by MOW workers is not subject to subpart C.</P>
        <P>To carry out the 1988 statutory amendment, FRA issued an interpretation in 1990 of the terms “clean,” “safe,” and “sanitary” as applied to railroad-provided camp cars occupied by employees, MOW workers, or both based on standards established by OSHA. 49 CFR part 228, app. C. In FRA's 1990 Guidelines, the agency noted that—</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>FRA believes that camp cars, either because of express limitations of local codes, or by virtue of their physical mobility, are generally not subject to state or local housing, sanitation, health, electrical or fire codes. Therefore, FRA is unable to rely upon state or local authorities to ensure that persons covered by the [Hours of Service] Act who reside in camp cars are afforded an opportunity for rest in `clean,' `safe,' and `sanitary' conditions. Accordingly, FRA must determine what adverse conditions might reasonably be expected to interfere with the ordinary person's ability to rest, so as to enunciate policy guidelines to be applied by FRA in enforcing the words `clean,' `safe,' and `sanitary' for purposes of the Act.</P>

        <FP>55 FR 30892, 30893, July 27, 1990.</FP>
        

        <P>Twenty years after the 1988 statutory amendment, Congress enacted section 420 of RSIA. Congress added requirements that all sleeping quarters provided by railroads to employees or MOW workers have “indoor toilets, potable water, and other features to protect the health of [employees and MOW workers] (amending 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1));” that any railroad that uses camp cars must “fully retrofit or replace” such cars to be in compliance with 49 U.S.C. 21106(a) by December 31, 2009 (<E T="03">see</E>new 49 U.S.C. 21106(b)); and that the Secretary prescribe regulations to implement 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1), requiring compliance by December 31, 2010 (<E T="03">see</E>new 49 U.S.C. 21106(c)).</P>

        <P>FRA has considered whether Congress intended for railroad-provided camp cars occupied by MOW workers to be subject to the restrictions of 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2) on their location. Clearly, by the express text of 49 U.S.C. 21106(c), the regulations mandated by that subsection are intended “to implement subsection (a)(1)” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1)), and not to implement both 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1) and 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2). Just as clearly, Congress did not amend 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2) itself, which bars beginning such construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters for covered service employees on or after July 8, 1976; Congress did not, for example, add language to subsection (a)(2) to prohibit beginning construction or reconstruction of railroad-provided camp cars used as sleeping quarters for MOW workers, with a new effective date in subsection (a)(2) itself.</P>
        <P>In the end, however, FRA concludes that Congress did intend such location restrictions in subsection (a)(2) to apply to camp cars exclusively occupied by MOW workers, based primarily on the language of subsection (b), which reads as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>(b) Camp cars.—Not later than December 31, 2009, any railroad carrier that uses camp cars shall fully retrofit or replace such cars in compliance with<E T="03">subsection (a).</E>
          </P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>(Emphasis added). 49 U.S.C. 21106(b). Congress could have written that the camp cars must be in compliance with “subsection (a)(1),” but it did not; instead Congress required compliance with subsection (a) as a whole, a two-paragraph provision that includes the prohibition on placing camp cars (and other forms of sleeping quarters) near certain switching or humping operations. It is a basic canon of statutory construction that all words of a statute should be given effect.</FP>
        <P>To give subsection (b) meaning, with respect to requiring camp cars to be in compliance with the old mandate of subsection (a)(2), some act must be required that is possible to perform in the future, specifically not later than the December 31, 2009, date stated in subsection (b). FRA reads that extra requirement imposed by subsection (b) to be that camp cars exclusively occupied by MOW workers be subject to subsection (a)(2). With respect to subsection (a)(2), which contains a compliance date about 32 years before the enactment of subsection (a)(2), a new compliance date would be necessary in order to avoid creating an unconstitutional, ex post facto law, and that is what Congress provided with the new statutory deadline for compliance of December 31, 2009. FRA does not read subsection (b) as supplanting the July 8, 1976, effective date of the prohibition in subsection (a)(2) with respect to construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters occupied by train employees, signal employees, or dispatching service employees. Rather, FRA reads the text of section 21106(b) as a direct, statutory requirement that railroads using camp cars as sleeping quarters see to it that the cars exclusively occupied by MOW workers comply with the statutory requirements of not only subsection (a)(1), but also subsection (a)(2), and to do so by December 31, 2009.</P>

        <P>Of course, it could be argued that Congress simply made a technical error in requiring that camp cars comply with all of subsection (a) and that it meant to say “subsection (a)(1),” particularly given that the requirement is to “retrofit or replace” the cars, not to “retrofit or replace and position” the cars. FRA thinks that the legislative history of section 420 of RSIA argues against such a strict interpretation. That legislative history indicates that that Congress invited FRA to take a new, more protective look at camp cars. The House precursor to section 420 of RSIA would have directly prohibited the use of camp cars entirely by statute, effective one year after the date of enactment.<E T="03">See</E>section 202 of H.R. 2095 as reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in H.R. Rep. No. 110-336 and analysis at p. 39. The Senate precursor to section 420 of RSIA would have authorized FRA to prohibit railroads' use of camp cars as sleeping quarters (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, by regulation or order) “if necessary to protect the health and safety of the employees.”<E T="03">See</E>section 410 of S. 1889 as reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in S. Rep. No. 110-270. Based on the plain meaning of 49 U.S.C. 21106 and the legislative history of section 420 of RSIA, FRA believes its interpretation applying the location requirement of subsection (a)(2) to camp cars occupied exclusively by MOW workers is both correct and appropriate.</P>

        <P>To carry out this statutory interpretation, FRA is proposing an<PRTPAGE P="67"/>amendment to subpart C. The statutory authority to conduct this aspect of the rulemaking is FRA's authority under 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2) to prescribe regulations to implement that statutory provision, which reads (as revised during the 1994 recodification of the rail safety laws effected by Pub.  L. 103-272) as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>A railroad carrier  * * *  (2) may not begin, after July 7, 1976, construction or reconstruction of sleeping quarters  * * *  in an area or in the immediate vicinity of an area,<E T="03">as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation</E>, in which railroad switching or humping operations are performed.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>[Emphasis added.] This is the authority under which FRA originally prescribed subpart C. 41 FR 53070, Dec. 3, 1976.</FP>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Section-by-Section Analysis</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part 228</HD>
        <P>FRA proposes to revise the name of 49 CFR part 228 to reflect all of its contents more explicitly. The current name of the part is “HOURS OF SERVICE OF RAILROAD EMPLOYEES”. FRA proposes to rename the part “HOURS OF SERVICE OF RAILROAD EMPLOYEES; RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING; SLEEPING QUARTERS”.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart A of Part 228</HD>
        <P>FRA proposes to tailor § 228.1, Scope, to reflect the addition of new subpart E, Safety and Health Requirements for Camp Cars Provided by Railroads as Sleeping Quarters such as by adding new paragraph (c).</P>
        <P>FRA also proposes to amend § 228.3, Application. Currently, that section, says that, in general, part 228 applies to railroads and contractors and subcontractors of railroads. FRA proposes to revise the section to indicate that although subparts B and D apply to railroads and contractors and subcontractors of railroads, subparts C and E apply only to railroads. Subpart A contains no duties that apply to any entity; its definitions apply to terms in the part as a whole or individual subparts. This section is being amended to clarify that both plant railroads and tourist railroads that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation are exempt from the requirements of part 228.</P>
        <P>Finally, FRA proposes to amend § 228.5, Definitions, by adding definitions of four terms. The terms “plant railroad” and “tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation” are used in the proposed “application” provisions of subpart A and proposed subpart E, and both terms refer to types of operations that have been traditionally been excluded from FRA regulations because they are not part of the general railroad system of transportation. There is a more extensive explanation of this system in appendix A to 49 CFR part 209, and it is explicitly defined there as “the network of standard gage track over which goods may be transported throughout the nation and passengers may travel between cities and within metropolitan and suburban areas.” The terms “camp car” and “MOW worker” are used in proposed subparts C and E. “Camp car” would be defined as “a trailer and/or on-track vehicle, including an outfit, camp, bunk car, or modular home mounted on a flatcar, or any other mobile vehicle or mobile structure used to house or accommodate an employee or MOW worker. A wreck train is not included.”</P>
        <P>The longstanding definition of “camp car” in the guidelines of 49 CFR part 228, app. C is clarified by adding “or any other mobile vehicle or mobile structure” as catch-all language. For example, a recreational vehicle would be a camp car. In addition, the phrase “railroad employees” is replaced with “an employee or MOW worker.” The term “employee” is defined in existing § 228.5 and means a train employee, signal employee, or dispatching service employee. The term “MOW worker” would be defined as “an individual employed to maintain the right of way of a railroad”; the language of the definition is based on the statutory provision at 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart B of Part 228</HD>

        <P>FRA proposes to remove § 228.13, Preemptive effect, for two reasons. First, the section is unnecessary because it is duplicative of statutory law at 49 U.S.C. 20106 and case law. Second, the section is incomplete because it omits reference to the preemptive effect of the hours of service laws (49 U.S.C. chapter 211), the authority for 49 CFR part 228, subparts C and E, as provided under case law. The hours of service laws have been interpreted by the Supreme Court as preempting State regulation of the hours of railroad employees.<E T="03">See Hill</E>v.<E T="03">State of Florida ex rel. Watson</E>, 325 U.S. 538, 553 (1945).</P>
        <P>In addition, FRA proposes to redesignate two provisions in subpart B that are intended to apply to the entire part in order to move them to subpart A, General. In particular, FRA proposes to redesignate § 228.21, Civil penalty, and § 228.23, Criminal penalty, as § 228.6, Penalty.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart C of Part 228</HD>
        <P>FRA proposes to change the heading of subpart C from “Construction of Employee Sleeping Quarters” to “Construction of Railroad-Provided Sleeping Quarters.” “Railroad-Provided” is added to emphasize that the regulations apply only to sleeping quarters that are provided by a railroad, and the word “Employee” is deleted since the proposed subpart would apply not only to sleeping quarters occupied by an employee but also to sleeping quarters in the form of a camp car that are provided by a railroad to an MOW worker.</P>
        <P>In § 228.101, the heading would be changed from “Distance requirement; definitions” to “Distance requirement for railroad-provided employee sleeping quarters; definitions used in this subpart.” This revision is intended to reflect that the section applies only to sleeping quarters for employees (not for MOW workers). That section reflects the 1976 statutory amendment discussed earlier in the preamble that carries a July 8, 1976, compliance date.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.102Distance Requirement for Camp Cars Provided by Railroads as Sleeping Quarters Exclusively for MOW Workers</HD>

        <P>In new § 228.102, FRA proposes to restate the statutory language at 49 U.S.C. 21106(b) and 21106(a)(2) by saying that a railroad that uses camp cars must comply by December 31, 2009, with the prohibition in 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2) with respect to those camp cars that are provided as sleeping quarters exclusively to MOW workers. (Camp cars for train employees, signal employees, or dispatching service employees or those occupied by both covered service employees and MOW workers are already subject to the July 8, 1976, compliance date in 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(2) and 49 CFR 228.101.) In other words, under the statute, starting December 31, 2009, a railroad must not begin construction or reconstruction of a camp car provided by the railroad as sleeping quarters exclusively for MOW workers within or in the immediate vicinity of any area where railroad switching or humping is performed. (Of course, compliance with the regulation itself would not be due until the date established in the final rule.) The key terms in the new proposed section are already defined in the subpart or at § 228.5. In effect, absent FRA's special approval in accordance with subpart C, a railroad may not begin construction or reconstruction of a camp car (including the placement of a camp car) for MOW workers in or within the distance<PRTPAGE P="68"/>specified in the regulations at 228.101(b) (one-half mile from the location where such switching or humping of placarded cars takes place). Procedures on requesting FRA's special approval are found within that subpart and at 49 CFR part 211. The proposed section notes that references to “employees” in the sections on procedures on §§ 228.103-228.107 must be read to include MOW workers if read in conjunction with the proposed section.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Subpart E of Part 228</HD>
        <P>FRA proposes to add new subpart E entitled, “Safety and Health Requirements for Camp Cars Provided by Railroads as Sleeping Quarters.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.301Purpose and scope</HD>
        <P>This proposed section is a basic restatement of the legal mandate in section 420 of RSIA that is codified at 49 U.S.C. 21106(c), which requires the issuance of regulations to implement 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1) with respect to certain camp cars. Section 21106(a)(1) of title 49 of the U.S. Code provides that sleeping quarters provided by a railroad to its covered service employees and MOW workers must be—</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>clean, safe, and sanitary, give those employees and individuals an opportunity for rest free from the interruptions caused by noise under the control of the carrier, and provide indoor toilet facilities, potable water, and other features to protect the health of employees  * * *.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <FP>As previously discussed, FRA does not currently have regulations addressing safety and health requirements for camp cars, but instead has published guidelines that interpret pre-RSIA statutory requirements. 49 CFR part 228, appendix C. The regulations proposed in this NPRM would update and supplant the outdated guidelines consistent with RSIA's requirements.</FP>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.303Application and Responsibility for Compliance</HD>

        <P>This proposed section defines the railroads that would be covered by the proposed new subpart. All railroads would be covered, with the exception of three types of railroad operations. The three listed exceptions are for operations that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation: (1) Railroads that operate exclusively on track that is not part of that system (plant railroads, as that term is defined in § 228.5); (2) tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion railroads that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation, a term also defined in § 228.5 (tourist railroads); and (3) rapid transit operations in an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation.<E T="03">See</E>49 CFR part 209, app. A for a discussion of “general railroad system of transportation.” As a matter of policy, FRA almost never exercises its statutory jurisdiction over plant railroads and generally does not exercise its statutory jurisdiction over tourist railroads that operate only off the general system. FRA lacks statutory jurisdiction over urban rapid transit operations not connected to the general system.<E T="03">See</E>49 U.S.C. 20102, 20103.</P>
        <P>In addition, proposed paragraph (b) explains that even though the subpart applies only to railroads, a railroad may not avoid fulfilling the requirements of this subpart by using contractors or subcontractors. If, for example, a railroad uses a contractor to provide dining services for the occupants of a camp car, FRA will still enforce the provisions of § 228.325 to ensure that the food service is safe and sanitary. FRA will hold the railroad liable for its contractor's or subcontractor's failing to fulfill the requirements of this proposed subpart.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.305Compliance Date</HD>
        <P>This proposed section establishes the deadline for compliance. A December 31, 2010 deadline for compliance with the regulations was set by Congress in section 420 of RSIA, but the final rule may not become effective until 60 days after it is published.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.307Definitions</HD>
        <P>This proposed section defines key terms used in proposed subpart E. The definitions are set forth alphabetically. FRA intends these definitions to clarify the meaning of terms as they are used in the text of the proposed subpart. Many of these definitions were originally set forth in FRA's 1990 Guidelines. In addition, many of these definitions have been taken from standards issued by OSHA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.309Structure, Emergency Egress, Lighting, Temperature, and Noise-Level Standards</HD>
        <P>This proposed section sets forth a series of requirements for camp cars provided by a railroad as sleeping quarters to employees and MOW workers. First, the section requires that the camp cars are constructed so as to provide protection from the elements. Second, the section requires that the camp cars provide an opportunity for rest free from interruptions caused by noise under the control of the railroad that provides the camp cars. The limit of 55 dB(A) that FRA intends to establish is based on the longstanding interpretation of the hours of service statutory provision related to sleeping quarters. 49 U.S.C. 21106(a)(1); 49 CFR part 228, app. A and C. It is notable that the 55 dB(A) level is typical of semi-urban and suburban neighborhood outside ambient noise during the evening hours with minimal street traffic. Levels such as these have also been measured in the same neighborhoods on side streets during daylight hours; thus, the 55 dB(A) limit should not be difficult to achieve. Third, this section requires that the camp cars be able to maintain a minimum temperature during cold weather and a maximum temperature during hot weather. FRA invites comment on whether the temperatures currently specified should be changed. Fourth, the section requires that camp cars provide an adequate means of egress in the event of an emergency situation. There must be an exit at both ends of the camp car so that occupants may pass through each end frame. Finally, FRA is also establishing minimum lighting standards, including provisions requiring the interior pathway to an emergency exit not immediately accessible to the occupants to be illuminated at all times for emergency egress purposes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.311Minimum Space Requirements</HD>
        <P>This proposed section requires that, to prevent overcrowding, the camp car's occupants have at least 50 square feet each; in a facility where occupants cook, live, and sleep, a minimum of 90 square feet per occupant must be provided. The proposed section also requires certain types of furniture.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.313Electrical System Requirements</HD>
        <P>This proposed section sets forth requirements regarding the safety of heating, cooking, ventilation, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. These systems must be installed in accordance with all applicable provisions of the 2008 version of the National Electrical Code. In addition, all electrical systems installed must be compliant with that code.</P>

        <P>This section of the proposed rule does not specify any certain code that must be used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, but does require that all such systems be safe and working. FRA anticipates that, to ensure that these systems are safe and operable, railroads will require HVAC systems in their camp cars to meet widely-adopted standards, such as those of the standards of the Sheet Metal and Air<PRTPAGE P="69"/>Conditioning Contractors National Association, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, and the American National Standards Institute. FRA is requesting comments on an appropriate standard to use for this provision as well as the practicability of FRA's attempting to enforce such standards. Please note that under 49 U.S.C. 20116, the date of adoption of a non-Federal standard incorporated by reference in a rail safety rule must be stated in the rule in order for the standard to become effective.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.315Vermin Control</HD>
        <P>This proposed section sets forth requirements related to the prevention and resolution of vermin infestations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.317Toilets</HD>
        <P>This proposed section represents a substantial revision of the parallel provision in FRA's 1990 Guidelines to reflect a more appropriate number of toilets required. Further, the proposed section requires that there be at least two toilet rooms located within a camp car that has sleeping facilities. Additionally, if a camp car is lodging more than 10 occupants, then an additional toilet room must be provided within the camp car for each group of one to five occupants in excess of the 10. For example, if there are 12 occupants lodged in a camp car, there must be a total of three toilet rooms in the camp car (two for the first ten occupants and one for the additional two occupants). FRA believes that this requirement provides an adequate standard for the minimum number of toilets. A toilet room must have a door that latches, one that is capable of being and staying securely closed and be sufficient to assure privacy. Certain construction and cleanliness standards are also included in this section.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.319Lavatories</HD>
        <P>This proposed section requires every camp car that provides a sleeping facility to have a basin with running water, soap, and hand-drying equipment or towels. It also requires at least two basins per car with sleeping facilities. If the running water available through a basin is not potable, a sign to that effect must be posted nearby.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.321Showering Facilities</HD>
        <P>The proposed section mandates a minimum number of showers, construction requirements for the showers, and the provision of showering supplies. If the running water available through a shower is not potable, a sign to that effect must be posted nearby.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.323Potable Water</HD>

        <P>This proposed section sets forth requirements to ensure that the water provided to the occupants of camp cars is safe. Potable water may be provided either as bottled water or as supplied through a plumbing system. Water uses such as personal oral hygiene, drinking, food washing, preparation, cooking, cleaning of the cooking utensils, cooking surfaces, and eating surfaces,<E T="03">etc.</E>all require the use of potable water. If the water supplied for these uses is provided by means of a system of tanks, lines and other plumbing, the integrity and cleanliness of such systems needs to be maintained. To ensure that this is done, FRA intends to establish requirements to facilitate this objective.</P>
        <P>Individuals who fill potable water systems servicing a camp car must be trained. The source for water provided to the occupants of a camp car must meet minimum standards put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency under 49 CFR part 141, National Primary Drinking Water Regulations. The railroad must obtain a certificate indicating this fact, which must be kept with the camp car for the duration of the connection, after which is must be sent to a centralized location, such as the railroad's system headquarters. This location should be the depository for all water certification records for the railroad. Equipment and construction employed to provide potable water to a camp car must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The water itself must be stored in sanitary containers and be dispensed so that sanitary conditions are maintained. Distribution lines must have adequate pressure for simultaneous use. Potable water systems must be flushed and disinfected regularly, and the steps that are taken must be recorded. Those records must be kept within the camp for the duration of the connection and then sent to a centralized location. The section sets forth procedures to follow in the instance of a report of a problem with the taste of the water or a report of a health problem because of the water.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.325Food Service in a Camp Car or Separate Kitchen or Dining Car</HD>
        <P>The proposed section prohibits the presence of food and beverages in toilet rooms and toxic materials areas, imposes requirements applicable when a central dining operation is provided, and ensures that food service facilities and operations will operate hygienically. The limitations of paragraphs (c) and (d) do not apply to food service from nearby restaurants that are subject to State law.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.327Sewage and Waste Collection and Disposal</HD>
        <P>This proposed section addresses the necessity of wastes being disposed to ensure a sanitary environment. Timely removal of all kinds of waste is mandated by proposed § 228.329(a). Camp cars must be equipped with a method to dispose of sewage according to proposed § 228.329(b). Appropriate waste containers for both general waste and food waste are required by proposed § 228.329(c) and (d), respectively.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.329Housekeeping</HD>
        <P>This proposed section requires that each camp car be kept as clean as is practicable given the type of work performed by the occupants of the car. The section also requires elimination of splinters, unnecessary holes, and other conditions or features that impede cleaning.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.331First Aid</HD>
        <P>This proposed section requires a first-aid kit in each camp car with specified contents. This list is based on the requirements for first-aid kits in passenger trains set forth in FRA's regulations on passenger train emergency preparedness at 49 CFR 239.101(a)(6), but adds a requirement of two elastic wraps. Railroads should add items to the first-aid kit as conditions warrant, for example, increasing the minimum number of bandages for a larger crew than normal or providing additional items if the occupants of the camp car regularly deal with hazardous material. Additional items railroads may consider providing include ammonia inhalants and a splint.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 228.333Repairs</HD>

        <P>The proposed section gives a limited amount of time for a railroad, after receiving notice from FRA to repair a camp car that does not comply with these regulations. The section also requires that a railroad provide alternate accommodations when a camp car does not provide the essential services such as proper cooling or heating. In addition, if a camp car is noncompliant with the requirements of this subpart, and the railroad otherwise would have provided meals for occupants, it must provide for alternate arrangement for meals. 49 CFR part 228, app. A and C. FRA is considering specifying exactly how quickly a railroad must provide alternative accommodations for occupants when a camp car lacks<PRTPAGE P="70"/>essential services and invites comment on this issue.</P>

        <P>Finally, the proposal would make conforming changes to appendix A to part 228 and remove appendix C to part 228. The proposal would revise appendix A (FRA's statement of agency policy and interpretation of the hours of service laws) by removing the paragraph discussing the 1990 Guidelines, codified in appendix C to part 228, and the rationale for establishing those guidelines because appendix C would be eliminated and superseded by new 49 CFR part 228, subpart E. The proposal would also remove appendix C to reflect that the guidelines with respect to camp cars would be revised and converted into regulations at 49 CFR part 228, subpart E, which would become effective upon the date that compliance with the regulations is first required.</P>

        <P>This rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policies and procedures, and determined to be non-significant under both Executive Order 12866 and DOT policies and procedures. 44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979. FRA has prepared and placed in the docket a regulatory evaluation addressing the economic impact of this proposed rulemaking. Document inspection and copying facilities are available at U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. Docket material is also available for inspection on the Internet at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>Photocopies may also be obtained by submitting a written request to the FRA Docket Clerk at the Office of Chief Counsel, RCC-10, Mail Stop 10, Federal Railroad Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590; please refer to Docket No. FRA-2009-0042.</P>
        <P>To carry out a 2008 Congressional rulemaking mandate, FRA is proposing to create a new subpart of part 228, subpart E, which would prescribe minimum safety and health requirements for camp cars that a railroad provides as sleeping quarters to any of its train employees, signal employees, and dispatching service employees and individuals employed to maintain its right of way. The proposed regulations would supplant existing FRA guidelines that interpret existing statutory requirements, enacted decades earlier, that railroad-provided camp cars be clean, safe, and sanitary, and afford those employees and individuals an opportunity for rest free from the interruptions caused by noise under the control of the railroad. In further response to the rulemaking mandate, the proposed regulations would include the additional statutory requirements, enacted in 2008, that camp cars be provided with indoor toilets, potable water, and other features to protect the health of such workers.</P>
        <P>Under separate but related statutory authority, FRA is proposing to amend subpart C of 49 CFR part 228, “Construction of Employee Sleeping Quarters.” In accordance with the RSIA, FRA applies the location restrictions applicable to employee occupied camp cars to railroad camp cars occupied solely by MOW workers.</P>
        <P>Finally, the proposal would make conforming changes to appendix A to part 228 and remove part appendix C to part 228. The proposal would also clarify its provision on applicability, remove an existing provision on the preemptive effect of part 228 as unnecessary, and move, without change, an existing provision on penalties for violation of part 228 from subpart B to subpart A.</P>
        <P>FRA estimates costs and benefits for the proposed rule. In this case, only one railroad would be affected, NS. NS has asserted and FRA assumes that they are in compliance due to statutory mandate or voluntary compliance with the 1990 guidelines. FRA expects NS's costs of complying with this proposed rule to be nominal and limited to such requirements as the installation of non-potable water signage and first-aid kit items. Consequently, NS is already experiencing the benefits that would flow from this NPRM. Any increase in realized benefits would be small. The main benefit of this proposed rule is the assurance it will provide that the health and safety benefits reaped by NS's upgrades will remain in place. FRA is confident that the benefits will more than justify incurring the nominal costs associated with implementation of the proposed rule. FRA is requesting comments on all aspects of this economic analysis, including its underlying assumptions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 13272</HD>

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency to review regulations to assess their impact on small entities. An agency must conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis unless it determines and certifies that a rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the FRA Administrator certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. No small railroads will be affected by the rule. FRA has prepared and placed in the docket this certification. FRA requests comments on this certification as well as all other aspects of this NPRM.</P>

        <P>“Small entity” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 601 as including a small business concern that is independently owned and operated, and is not dominant in its field of operation. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has authority to regulate issues related to small businesses, and stipulates in its size standards that a “small entity” in the railroad industry is a for profit “line-haul railroad” that has fewer than 1,500 employees, a “short line railroad” with fewer than 500 employees, or a “commuter rail system” with annual receipts of less than seven million dollars.<E T="03">See</E>“Size Eligibility Provisions and Standards,” 13 CFR part 121, subpart A. Additionally, 5 U.S.C 601(5) defines as “small entities” governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts with populations less than 50,000. Federal agencies use a different standard for small entities, in consultation with SBA and in conjunction with public comment. Pursuant to that authority FRA has published a final statement of agency policy that formally establishes “small entities” or “small businesses” as being railroads, contractors and hazardous materials shippers that meet the revenue requirements of a Class III railroad as set forth in 49 CFR 1201.1-1, which is $20 million or less in inflation-adjusted annual revenues, and commuter railroads or small governmental jurisdictions that serve populations of 50,000 or less.<E T="03">See</E>68 FR 24891, May 9, 2003, codified at Appendix C to 49 CFR part 209. The $20 million limit is based on the Surface Transportation Board's<PRTPAGE P="71"/>revenue threshold for a Class III railroad carrier. Railroad revenue is adjusted for inflation by applying a revenue deflator formula in accordance with 49 CFR 1201.1-1. FRA is using this definition for this rulemaking.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">factual basis</E>for the certification that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities is that no small entities are affected. This proposed rule would affect only one railroad, the Norfolk Southern Railway, which is a Class I railroad with revenues far exceeding inflation-adjusted $20 million. Accordingly, FRA does not consider this impact to be significant. Nor does FRA anticipate that this regulation would result in long-term or short-term insolvency for any small railroad.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Federalism Implications</HD>
        <P>Executive Order 13132, “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, Aug. 10, 1999), requires FRA to develop an accountable process to ensure “meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.” “Policies that have federalism implications” are defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have “substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.” Under Executive Order 13132, the agency may not issue a regulation with federalism implications that imposes substantial direct compliance costs and that is not required by statute, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs incurred by State and local governments, the agency consults with State and local governments, or the agency consults with State and local government officials early in the process of developing the regulation. Where a regulation has federalism implications and preempts State law, the agency seeks to consult with State and local officials in the process of developing the regulation.</P>
        <P>This NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13132. This proposed rule would not have a substantial effect on the States or their political subdivisions; it would not impose any direct compliance costs on State and local governments; and it would not affect the relationships between the Federal government and the States or their political subdivisions, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. FRA has also determined that this proposed rule would not impose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments. Therefore, the consultation and funding requirements of Executive Order 13132 do not apply.</P>

        <P>However, this proposed rule could have preemptive effect by operation of law under a provision of the former Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, 49 U.S.C. 20106 (Section 20106), and case law interpreting the statutory predecessor of the hours of service laws at 49 U.S.C. chapter 211 (the Hours of Service Act).<E T="03">See</E>Public Law 103-272. Section 20106 provides that States may not adopt or continue in effect any law, regulation, or order related to railroad safety or security that covers the subject matter of a regulation prescribed or order issued by the Secretary of Transportation (with respect to railroad safety matters) or the Secretary of Homeland Security (with respect to railroad security matters), except when the State law, regulation, or order qualifies under the “local safety or security hazard” exception to Section 20106. The Hours of Service Act has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as preempting State regulation of the hours of railroad employees.<E T="03">See Hill</E>v.<E T="03">State of Florida ex rel. Watson,</E>325 U.S. 538, 553 (1945).</P>
        <P>In sum, FRA has analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 13132. As explained above, FRA has determined that this proposed rule has no federalism implications, other than the possible preemption of State laws. Accordingly, FRA has determined that preparation of a federalism summary impact statement for this proposed rule is not required.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. International Trade Impact Assessment</HD>
        <P>The Trade Agreement Act of 1979 prohibits Federal agencies from engaging in any standards or related activities that create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States. Legitimate domestic objectives, such as safety, are not considered unnecessary obstacles. The statute also requires consideration of international standards and where appropriate, that they be the basis for U.S. standards. This rulemaking is purely domestic in nature and is not expected to affect trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or for foreign firms doing business in the United States.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to Section 201 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4, 2 U.S.C. 1531), each Federal agency “shall, unless otherwise prohibited by law, assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments, and the private sector (other than to the extent that such regulations incorporate requirements specifically set forth in law).” Section 202 of the Act (2 U.S.C. 1532) further requires that “before promulgating any general notice of proposed rulemaking that is likely to result in the promulgation of any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) [$140.8 million in 2010] in any 1 year, and before promulgating any final rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking was published, the agency shall prepare a written statement” detailing the effect on State, local, and Tribal governments and the private sector. This final rule would not result in the expenditure, in the aggregate, of $140.8 million or more in any one year, and thus preparation of such a statement is not required.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Environmental Assessment</HD>

        <P>FRA has evaluated this proposed rule in accordance with its “Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts” (FRA's Procedures) (64 FR 28545, May 26, 1999) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>), other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and related regulatory requirements. FRA has determined that this proposed rule is not a major FRA action (requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment) because it is categorically excluded from detailed environmental review pursuant to section 4(c)(20) of FRA's Procedures.<E T="03">See</E>64 FR 28547, May 26, 1999. Section 4(c)(20) reads as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>(c) Actions categorically excluded. Certain classes of FRA actions have been determined to be categorically excluded from the requirements of these Procedures as they do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.</P>
          <P>* * *</P>
          <P>The following classes of FRA actions are categorically excluded:</P>

        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>In accordance with section 4(c) and (e) of FRA's Procedures, the agency has further concluded that no extraordinary circumstances exist with respect to this regulation that might trigger the need for a more detailed environmental review. As a result, FRA finds that this proposed rule is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</P>

        <P>Executive Order 13211 requires Federal agencies to prepare a Statement of Energy Effects for any “significant energy action.” 66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001. Under the Executive Order, a “significant energy action” is defined as any action by an agency (normally published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking: (1)(i) That is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or any successor order, and (ii) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (2) that is designated by the<PRTPAGE P="73"/>Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as a significant energy action. FRA has evaluated this NPRM in accordance with Executive Order 13211. FRA has determined that this NPRM is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy.

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>On October 20, 2006, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) submitted a petition to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requesting that the agency initiate rulemaking to amend the Federal motor vehicle safety standards to require vehicle manufacturers to install a device to limit the speed of trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 26,000 pounds to no more than 68 miles per hour (mph). The ATA claimed that reducing speed-related crashes involving trucks is critical to the safety mission of NHTSA, and that these new requirements are needed to reduce the number and severity of crashes involving large trucks.</P>
        <P>On September 8, 2006, Road Safe America and a group of nine motor carriers also petitioned the agency to require that manufacturers install a speed limiting device in vehicles with a GVWR over 26,000 pounds and that the devices be set at not more than 68 mph. They also requested that the requirements apply to all trucks manufactured after 1990.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of the Petitions</HD>
        <P>A detailed discussion of the two petitions can be found in the request for comments notice. Items specific to NHTSA include the following requests from ATA:</P>
        <P>1. All newly manufactured trucks with a GVWR greater than 26,000 pounds shall be equipped with an electronic control module (ECM) that is capable of limiting the maximum speed of the vehicle.</P>
        <P>2. The ECM shall be set at no more than 68 mph by the manufacturer.</P>
        <P>3. The ECM should be tamper-resistant, and should be designed in a way that does not allow the speed limiter setting on the ECM to be adjusted to let the vehicle exceed 68 mph.</P>
        <P>4. Immediately upon the rule taking effect, manufacturers should be prohibited from setting the ECM speed limiter to a maximum speed of greater than 68 mph. However, this requirement should not take effect earlier than the effective date of a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) rule prohibiting vehicle owners or operators from setting the ECM speed limiter at a level greater than 68 mph for newly manufactured trucks.</P>
        <P>5. The effective date for installation of a tamper-resistant ECM should be established with a period of time that will allow manufacturers to undergo a systems integration process. The change to the engine ECM may affect other devices on the vehicle; therefore, manufacturers need some time to ensure that the vehicle functions properly. ATA encourages NHTSA to seek information from manufacturers to determine the length of time necessary to come into compliance with the rule.</P>
        <P>6. An appropriate tolerance to accommodate variations in manufacturing, wear, and maintenance throughout the lifecycle of the vehicle. For example, the same diameter heavy truck tire but with a different width and sidewall aspect ratio may have a 15-20 revolutions per mile difference which will affect the actual top speed of the truck with a governed speed of 68 mph. ATA recommends that any rulemaking pertaining to this petition reference SAE J678, J862, and J1226 Recommended Practices.</P>
        
        <FP>In addition to items similar to those in ATA's petition, Road Safe America also included an item on retrofitting in its petition:</FP>
        
        <P>1. Every class 7 and class 8 commercial motor vehicle manufactured after the year 1990 shall be equipped with an electronic engine speed governor.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Comments</HD>

        <P>On January 26, 2007, NHTSA and FMCSA published a joint Request for Comments Notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>soliciting public comments on<PRTPAGE P="79"/>the ATA and Road Safe America petitions. The Department of Transportation Docket Management System received approximately 3,850 comments into Docket No. NHTSA-2007-26851, the majority of which were submitted by private citizens. Of these, many comments supported a regulation that would limit the speed of large trucks to 68 mph, which included comments from trucking fleets and consumer advocacy groups, and others. Other comments submitted by independent owner-operator truckers, a trucking fleet association, and private citizens were opposed to the rulemaking requested in the petitions. The remaining comments did not explicitly indicate a position with regard to the petitions.</P>
        <P>Comments from private citizens supporting the petitions include responses from individuals who were involved in crashes with heavy trucks or had friends/relatives who were involved in crashes with large trucks. The private citizen supporters of the petitions are typically non-truck drivers who stated that they are intimidated by the hazardous driving practices of some truck drivers, such as speeding, tailgating, and abrupt lane changes. These commenters expressed the belief that limiting the speed of heavy trucks to 68 mph will result in safer highways.</P>
        <P>Some of the organizations supporting the petition provided similar reasons for their support and the selected comments summarized below cover the range of issues they discussed.</P>
        <P>Schneider National, Inc., a major trucking fleet, indicated that its trucks have been speed limited to 65 mph since 1996. According to Schneider's crash data from its own fleet, vehicles without speed limiters accounted for 40 percent of the company's serious collisions while driving 17 percent of the company's total miles. Schneider stated that its vehicles have a significantly lower crash rate than large trucks that are not speed limited or have a maximum speed setting greater than 65 mph.</P>
        <P>J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., another trucking fleet, commented that a differential speed between cars and large trucks will result from trucks being equipped with speed limiters set below the posted speed limit. This speed differential may cause a safety hazard. However, J. B. Hunt believes that the current safety hazard caused by large trucks traveling at speeds in excess of posted limits is a greater safety hazard.</P>
        <P>Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) commented that large trucks require 20-40 percent more braking distance than passenger cars and light trucks for a given travel speed. Advocates does not believe that the data in the 1991 report to Congress<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>are still valid because the speed limits posted by the States over the past ten years are much higher than the national posted speed limit of 55 mph that was in effect in 1991.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>2</SU>Comercial Motor Vehicle Speed Control Devices (1991), DOT HS 807 725.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) stated that 97 percent of the occupants that are killed in crashes between heavy trucks and passenger vehicles are passenger vehicle occupants. IIHS stated that on-board electronic engine control modules (ECM) will maintain the desired speed control for vehicles when enforcement efforts are not sufficient due to lack of resources. IIHS stated that there is already widespread use of speed governors by carriers and a mandate will result in net safety and economic benefits.</P>
        <P>The Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) stated that large trucks are 3 percent of registered vehicles and represent about 8 percent of the total miles traveled nationwide. Also, GHSA believes that it is prudent to consider speed limiting devices since they are currently installed in large trucks and can be adapted to be tamper-resistant. It stated that conventional approaches to vehicle speed control do not provide optimal benefits because of a lack of enforcement resources and too many miles of highway to cover.</P>
        <P>Several comments, including those from ATA's Truck Maintenance Council, provided information concerning economic, non-safety benefits that would result from large truck speed limiters. The Truck Maintenance Council stated that an increase of 1 mph results in a 0.1 mpg increase in fuel consumption, and for every 1 mph increase in speed over 55 mph, there is a reduction of 1 percent in tire tread life.</P>
        <P>Comments opposing rulemaking that would require speed limiters on large trucks to be set to a maximum speed of 68 mph were received from many independent truck drivers, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), the Truckload Carriers Association (TCA), and private citizens (non-truck drivers).</P>
        <P>OOIDA commented that the 1991 report to Congress<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>is still valid today—there is no need to mandate speed limiters because the target population (high speed crashes) is still small compared to the total number of truck crashes. According to OOIDA, speed limiters would not have an effect on crashes in areas where the posted speed limit for trucks is 65 mph or below. OOIDA believes that the petitioners are attempting to force all trucks to be speed limited so that the major trucking companies with speed limited vehicles can compete for drivers with the independent trucking operations that have not limited their speeds to 68 mph or below. OOIDA also stated that it is not necessary to set large truck speed limiters at 68 mph to realize most of the economic benefits cited by the petitioners because improved fuel economy and reduced emissions can be achieved with improved truck designs.</P>

        <P>TCA commented that a speed differential will be created in many States by the 68-mph speed limit for heavy trucks and a higher speed limit for other vehicles. This speed differential will result in more interaction between cars and trucks and may be an additional safety risk for cars and trucks.</P>
        <P>According to comments from CDW Transport, a trucking fleet, speed limiters should be required on passenger vehicles as well as commercial motor vehicles.</P>
        <P>Several comments from private citizens and small businesses opposed to the petitions stated that speed is not the only cause of crashes, that weather and highway conditions are also significant factors. There were comments stating that passenger vehicles cause the majority of the crashes between trucks and passenger vehicles. Some comments stated that truck drivers will experience more fatigue with a 68-mph maximum speed, which could result in more crashes; some comments expressed the opinion that State and local law enforcement agencies should enforce the speed of all vehicles on the nation's roads and highways; several comments favored a 75-mph limit for truck speed limiters, instead of 68 mph, to match the highest posted speed limit in the country.</P>

        <P>The Truck Manufacturers Association (TMA) provided information concerning the cost of tamper-proof speed limiters for large trucks. TMA estimates a one-time cost of $35 to $50 million would be required to develop ECMs with tamper-resistant speed limiters and a one-time cost of $150 million to $200 million to develop ECMs with tamper-proof speed limiters. With both of these ECM designs, there would be additional costs to make adjustments to the ECM for maximum speed, tire size, and drive axle and transmission gear ratio information.<PRTPAGE P="80"/>

        <P>The Administrative Conference of the United States was established by the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C. 591-596. The Conference studies the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures used by Federal agencies in carrying out administrative programs, and makes recommendations for improvements to the agencies, collectively or individually, and to the President, Congress, and the Judicial Conference of the United States (5 U.S.C. 594(1)). At its Fifty-third Plenary Session, held December 9 and 10, 2010, the Assembly of the Administrative Conference of the United States adopted the attached recommendation. For further information about the Conference and its activities,<E T="03">see http://www.acus.gov.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Recommendation 2010-1, “Agency Procedures for Considering Preemption of State Law,” addresses issues relating to agency procedures for complying with Federal requirements regarding consultation with State and local governments and for considering State interests in rulemakings that may result in the preemption of State law. The goal of the recommendation is not to favor or disfavor preemption, but to improve agency procedures in potentially preemptive rulemakings. The recommendation reiterates a previous Conference recommendation that Congress clearly state its preemptive intent in the text of the statutes it charges Federal agencies with implementing. It recommends that agencies formulate appropriate internal procedures to ensure consultation with representatives of State interests and to ensure that agencies evaluate the authority and basis asserted in support of a preemptive rulemaking. It seeks to increase transparency regarding internal agency policies and recommends ways to improve external mechanisms for enforcing the applicable Federal requirements.</P>
        <P>The full text of the recommendation is set out in the Appendix below. The recommendation will be transmitted to affected agencies and to appropriate committees of the United States Congress. The Administrative Conference has advisory powers only, and the decision on whether to implement the recommendation must be made by the affected agencies or by Congress.</P>

        <P>The Administrative Conference ceased operations in 1995 due to termination of funding, but was re-established in 2010, and the Council of the revived Administrative Conference held its first meeting in August 2010. The December 2010 Plenary Session was the first held after the resumption of operations. Recommendations and statements of the Administrative Conference are published in full text in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The research report on which Recommendation 2010-1 is based and a complete listing of past recommendations and statements are available at<E T="03">http://www.acus.gov.</E>

          <P>Presidents Reagan and Clinton both issued executive orders mandating executive branch agencies,<SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/>and urging independent agencies,<SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/>to take certain measures to ensure proper respect for principles of federalism. Executive Order 13132, “Federalism,” issued by President Clinton on August 4, 1999 (the “Order”),<SU>3</SU>
            <FTREF/>is still in effect today, and is an amended version of President Reagan's Executive Order on Federalism, Executive Order 12612.<SU>4</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Order identifies federalism principles that bear consideration in policymaking and specifies procedures for intergovernmental consultation, emphasizing consultations with State and local governments and enhanced sensitivity to their concerns. The Order requires agencies to have “an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications.”<SU>5</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Order requires agencies to “provide all affected State and local officials notice and an opportunity for appropriate participation in the proceedings” whenever an agency proposes to preempt State law through adjudication or rulemaking.<SU>6</SU>
            <FTREF/>It establishes specific procedures for “any regulation that has federalism implications and that preempts State law,”<SU>7</SU>
            <FTREF/>requiring agencies to consult with State and local officials “early in the process of developing the proposed regulation,”<SU>8</SU>
            <FTREF/>and to prepare a federalism impact statement (“FIS”).<SU>9</SU>

          <P>Individual agencies are responsible for implementing Executive Order 13132, and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (“OIRA”), located within the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), has issued procedural guidelines on “what agencies should do to comply with the Order and how they should document that compliance to OMB.”<SU>10</SU>
            <FTREF/>These Federalism Guidelines provide that each agency and department should designate a federalism official charged with: (1) Ensuring that the agency considers federalism principles in its development of regulatory and legislative policies with federalism implications; (2) ensuring that the agency has an accountable process for meaningful and timely intergovernmental consultation in the development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications; and (3) providing certification of compliance to OMB. The federalism official must submit to OMB “a description of the agency's consultation process,”<SU>11</SU>
            <FTREF/>that “indicate[s] how the agency identifies those policies with federalism implications and the procedures the agency will use to ensure meaningful and timely consultation with affected State and local officials.”<SU>12</SU>
            <FTREF/>For any draft final regulation with federalism implications submitted for OIRA review under Executive Order 12866, the federalism official must certify that the requirements of Executive Order 13132 concerning both the evaluation of federalism policies and consultation have been met in a meaningful and timely manner.<SU>13</SU>

          <P>President Obama's official policy on preemption, articulated in a May 20, 2009 presidential “Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies” (“Preemption Memorandum”), provides that “[p]reemption of State law by executive departments and agencies should be undertaken only with full consideration of the legitimate prerogatives of the States and with a sufficient legal basis for preemption.”<SU>14</SU>
            <FTREF/>It specifically admonishes department and agency heads to cease the practice of including preemption statements in the preamble to a regulation without including it in the codified regulation. And it further directs agencies to include preemption provisions in codified regulations only to the extent “justified under legal principles governing preemption, including the principles outlined in Executive Order 13132.” Finally, the Preemption Memorandum requests that agencies conduct a 10-year retrospective review of regulations including preemption statements, whether in the preamble or the codified regulation, “in order to decide whether such statements or provisions are justified under applicable legal principles governing preemption.”</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>An empirical evaluation of agency practices reveals that compliance with the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132 has been inconsistent, although President Obama's Preemption Memorandum has effectuated a meaningful shift in preemption policies within a number of agencies. This evaluation was based on statistical analysis of agency rulemaking practices, on particular examples of agency rulemakings, on recent interviews with officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and on consideration of legislative changes to statutes relevant to agency preemption and an independent review of the agencies' respective rulemaking dockets and intervention in litigation.</P>
          <P>There appears to be consensus that the requirements of the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132—including consultation with the States and the requirement for “federalism impact statements”—are sound. But compliance with these provisions has been inconsistent, and difficulties have persisted across administrations of both political parties. A 1999 GAO Report identified only five rules—out of a total of 11,000 issued from April 1996 to December 1998<SU>15</SU>
            <FTREF/>—that included a federalism impact assessment.<SU>16</SU>
            <FTREF/>Case studies of particular rulemaking proceedings have revealed failures to comply with Executive Order 13132.<SU>17</SU>
            <FTREF/>In August 2010, reflecting continued concern with agency practices in this area, the ABA House of Delegates adopted a recommendation developed by the ABA Task Force on Federal Preemption of State Tort Laws, aimed at improving compliance with the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132.<SU>18</SU>

          <P>This Administrative Conference Recommendation is intended to improve agency procedures for implementing the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132 and to increase transparency regarding internal agency policies and external enforcement mechanisms designed to ensure compliance with those provisions. The goal is not to favor or disfavor preemption, but to improve agency procedures in potentially preemptive rulemakings. The Recommendation is also intended to facilitate Federal agency consultation with State representatives, such as the “Big Seven,” a group of nonpartisan, non-profit organizations composed of State and local government officials,<SU>19</SU>

            <FTREF/>and, conversely, to facilitate State officials' awareness of and responsiveness to, opportunities to consult with Federal officials and to comment in regulatory proceedings that may have preemptive effect. Improved communication on preemption issues would result if State and local government officials or their representative organizations availed themselves of opportunities to become aware of whether Federal agencies are engaging in potentially preemptive rulemaking proceedings, for example, by monitoring the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>or using relevant Internet dashboards, such as are available at<E T="03">http://www.reginfo.gov.</E>Agencies can ensure that these tools are optimally useful to State representatives by clearly posting relevant information on their individual Web sites and providing appropriate information for inclusion in the semiannual Unified Agenda. Finally, this Recommendation is aimed at both executive branch and independent agencies that engage in preemptive rulemaking, with the recognition that the executive directives described above bind the former and urge voluntarily compliance by the latter.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>19</SU>The Big Seven include the Council of State Governments, the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/County Management Association.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>The Conference recognizes the danger of encumbering the rulemaking process with too many formal requirements. Therefore, in crafting this Recommendation, the Conference has remained mindful of the continuing validity of its previous<PRTPAGE P="83"/>Recommendation aimed at reducing “ossification” of the regulatory process.<SU>20</SU>
            <FTREF/>The Conference recognizes, however, that certain principles, including those embodied in the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132, are sufficiently important to warrant systematic consideration by agencies engaging in rulemaking. The following Recommendation has accordingly been structured both to encourage compliance with existing executive directives and increase the efficiency of internal agency processes designed to ensure such compliance.</P>

          <P>2. Agencies that engage in rulemaking proceedings that may have preemptive effect on State law should have internal written guidance to ensure compliance with the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132, which should describe:</P>
          <P>a. How the agency determines the need for any preemption;</P>
          <P>b. How the agency consults with State and local officials concerning preemption; and</P>
          <P>c. How the agency otherwise ensures compliance with the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132.</P>
          <P>3. Agencies should post their internal guidance for compliance with the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132 on the Internet or otherwise make publicly available the information contained therein.</P>
          <P>4. Agencies should have an oversight procedure to improve agency procedures for implementing the preemption provisions of Executive Order 13132. This procedure should include an internal process for evaluating the authority and basis asserted in support of a preemptive rulemaking. The agency should provide a reasoned basis, with such evidence as may be appropriate, that supports its preemption conclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Updated Policies To Ensure Timely Consultation With State and Local Interests Concerning Preemption</HD>
          <P>5. Agencies should have a consultation process that contains elements such as the following:</P>
          <P>a. Agencies should use an updated contact list for representatives of State interests, including but not limited to the “Big Seven.” The Administrative Conference will maintain such a list for use by agencies.</P>
          <P>b. Agencies should maintain some form of regularized personal contact in order to build relationships with representatives of State interests.</P>
          <P>c. Agencies should disclose to the public when they meet with the representatives of State interests in the course of rulemaking proceedings that may preempt State law. The disclosure should include the identity of the organization(s) or institution(s) that participate and the subject matter of the discussion.</P>
          <P>d. Agencies should reach out to appropriate State and local officials early in the process when they are considering preemptive rules. Such outreach should, to the extent practicable, precede issuance of the notice of proposed rulemaking.</P>
          <P>6. Agencies should establish contact with organizations and State and local regulatory bodies and officials that have relevant substantive expertise or jurisdiction.</P>
          <P>7. Agencies should adopt, as one component of their notice practice, a procedure for notifying State attorneys general when they are considering rules that may have preemptive effect. This may be achieved via direct communication with State attorneys general and by contacting an appropriate representative organization such as, for example, the National Association of Attorneys General.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Actions by OIRA/OMB To Improve the Process</HD>
          <P>8. OIRA/OMB should request agencies to post on their open government Web sites a summary of the agencies' responses to the directive contained in the Preemption Memorandum to conduct a 10-year retrospective review of preemptive rulemaking.</P>
          <P>9. OIRA/OMB should update its Federalism Guidelines with respect to preemption.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, “Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,” regulate, among other things, the introduction (importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests. Such genetically engineered organisms and products are considered “regulated articles.”</P>
        <P>The regulations in § 340.6(a) provide that any person may submit a petition to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) seeking a determination that an article should not be regulated under 7 CFR part 340. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 340.6 describe the form that a petition for a determination of nonregulated status must take and the information that must be included in the petition.</P>

        <P>APHIS has received a petition (APHIS Petition Number 08-338-01p) from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer) of Johnston, IA, seeking a determination of nonregulated status for corn (<E T="03">Zea mays</E>L.) designated as DP-32138-1, which has been genetically engineered to produce male sterile/female inbred plants for the generation of hybrid corn seed that is non-transgenic, stating that corn event DP-32138-1 is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk and, therefore, should not be a regulated article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340.</P>
        <P>As described in the petition, the controlled expression of a seed color marker gene and pollen fertility and sterility genes allows for the generation of red transgenic seed for seed increase of male sterile-female inbred lines and for the production of non-transgenic fertile pollen for use in non-transgenic hybrid commercial seed production. Corn event DP-32138-1 is currently regulated under 7 CFR part 340. Interstate movements and field tests of corn event DP-32138-1 have been conducted under permits issued or notifications acknowledged by APHIS.</P>
        <P>Field tests conducted under APHIS oversight allowed for evaluation in a natural agricultural setting while imposing measures to minimize the risk of persistence in the environment after completion of the test. Data are gathered on multiple parameters and used by the applicant to evaluate agronomic characteristics and product performance. These data are used by APHIS to determine if the new variety poses a plant pest risk. Pioneer has petitioned APHIS to make a determination that corn event DP-32138-1 shall no longer be considered a regulated article under 7 CFR part 340.</P>
        <P>In section 403 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701<E T="03">et seq.</E>), “plant pest” is defined as any living stage of any of the following that can directly or indirectly injure, cause damage to, or cause disease in any plant or plant product: A protozoan, a nonhuman animal, a parasitic plant, a bacterium, a fungus, a virus or viroid, an infectious agent or other pathogen, or any article similar to or allied with any of the foregoing. APHIS has prepared a plant pest risk assessment to determine if corn event DP-32138-1 is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk.</P>

        <P>APHIS has also prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA) in which it presents two alternatives based on its analyses of data submitted by Pioneer, a review of other scientific data, and field tests conducted under APHIS oversight. APHIS is considering the following alternatives: (1) Take no action,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>APHIS would not change the regulatory status of corn event DP-32138-1 and it would continue to be a regulated article, or (2) grant nonregulated status to corn event DP-32138-1 in whole.</P>

        <P>The draft EA has been prepared to provide the APHIS decisionmaker with a review and analysis of any potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed determination of nonregulated status for corn event DP-32138-1. The draft EA was prepared in accordance with (1) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>), (2) regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS' NEPA Implementing Procedures (7 CFR part 372).</P>

        <P>In accordance with § 340.6(d) of the regulations, we are publishing this notice to inform the public that APHIS will accept written comments regarding the petition for a determination of nonregulated status from interested or affected persons for a period of 60 days from the date of this notice. We are also soliciting written comments from interested or affected persons on the draft EA prepared to examine any potential environmental impacts of the proposed determination for the deregulation of the subject corn line, and the plant pest risk assessment. The petition, draft EA, and plant pest risk assessment are available for public review, and copies of the petition, draft EA, and plant pest risk assessment are available as indicated under<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>and<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>above.</P>

        <P>After the comment period closes, APHIS will review all written comments received during the comment period and any other relevant information. All comments received regarding the petition, draft EA, and plant pest risk assessment will be available for public review. After reviewing and evaluating the comments on the petition, the draft EA, plant pest risk assessment, and other data, APHIS will furnish a response to the petitioner, either approving or denying the petition. APHIS will then publish a notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>announcing the regulatory status of corn event DP-32138-1 and the availability of APHIS' written environmental decision and regulatory determination.</P>

          <P>The United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Prescott National Forest, is withdrawing the March 2, 2010,<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice (75 FR 9388) which announced their intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act,<PRTPAGE P="85"/>42 U.S.C. 4321 (NEPA), to analyze the environmental impacts of vegetation management treatments in the Prescott Basin area. The original proposal included vegetation treatments to reduce fuels exceeding 9″ in diameter in Mexican Spotted Owl (MSO) Protected Activity Centers. This proposal would have been in conflict with the MSO recovery guidelines that had been incorporated into the Prescott National Forest's Land and Resource Management Plan. Subsequently the Forest Service entered into a new consultation with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the MSO and other threatened or endangered species. During this period of re-consultation, the responsible official on Prescott National Forest has determined that it would be unwise to pursue such vegetation treatments that could result in a negative impact to the MSO. Without these treatments in MSO protected activity centers, it was recognized that significant impacts to the environment would be highly unlikely, and therefore an Environmental Impact Statement would probably not be required and an Environmental Assessment would be prepared.</P>

The required contents of a substantive response, on an order-specific basis, are set forth at 19 CFR 351.218(d)(3).

This requirement was retained in the final sunset regulations at 19 CFR 351.218(d)(4). As provided in 19 CFR 351.302(b), however, the Department will consider individual requests to extend that five-day deadline based upon a showing of good cause.</P>

          <P>Sheila E. Forbes, Office of AD/CVD Operations, Customs Unit, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230, telephone: (202) 482-4697.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
          <P>Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, finding, or suspension of investigation, an interested party, as defined in section 771(9) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (“the Act”), may request, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.213, that the Department of Commerce (“the Department”) conduct an administrative review of that antidumping or countervailing duty order, finding, or suspended investigation.</P>
          <P>All deadlines for the submission of comments or actions by the Department discussed below refer to the number of calendar days from the applicable starting date.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Respondent Selection</HD>

          <P>In the event the Department limits the number of respondents for individual examination for administrative reviews initiated pursuant to requests made for the orders identified below, except for the review of the antidumping duty order on Wooden Bedroom Furniture from the People's Republic of China (“PRC”) (A-570-890), the Department intends to select respondents based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) data for U.S. imports during the period of review (“POR”). We intend to<PRTPAGE P="91"/>release the CBP data under Administrative Protective Order (“APO”) to all parties having an APO within seven days of publication of the initiation notice and to make our decision regarding respondent selection within 21 days of publication of the initiation<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice. Therefore, we encourage all parties interested in commenting on respondent selection to submit their APO applications on the date of publication of the initiation notice, or as soon thereafter as possible. The Department invites comments regarding the CBP data and respondent selection within five days of placement of the CBP data on the record of the review.</P>
          <P>If the Department limits the number of respondents selected for individual examination in the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on wooden bedroom furniture from the PRC, it intends to select respondents based on volume data contained in responses to quantity and value questionnaires. Further, the Department intends to limit the number of quantity and value questionnaires issued in the wooden bedroom furniture from the PRC review based on CBP data for U.S. imports classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”) headings identified in the scope of the order. Since the units used to measure import quantities are not consistent for the HTSUS headings identified in the scope of the order on wooden bedroom furniture from the PRC, the Department will limit the number of quantity and value questionnaires issued based on the import values in CBP data as a proxy for import quantities. Parties subject to the review to which the Department does not send a quantity and value questionnaire may file a response to the quantity and value questionnaire by the applicable deadline if they desire to be included in the pool of companies from which the Department will select mandatory respondents. Additionally, exporters subject to the review to which the Department does not send a quantity and value questionnaire may file a separate rate application or separate rate certification, as appropriate, by the applicable deadline without filing a response to the quantity and value questionnaire.</P>

          <P>In accordance with 19 CFR 351.213(b), an interested party as defined by section 771(9) of the Act may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For both antidumping and countervailing duty reviews, the interested party must specify the individual producers or exporters covered by an antidumping finding or an antidumping or countervailing duty order or suspension agreement for which it is requesting a review. In addition, a domestic interested party or an interested party described in section 771(9)(B) of the Act must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or exporters.<SU>4</SU>
            <FTREF/>If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by an exporter (or a producer if that producer also exports merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically, on an order-by-order basis, which exporter(s) the request is intended to cover.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>4</SU>If the review request involves a non-market economy and the parties subject to the review request do not qualify for separate rates, all other exporters of subject merchandise from the non-market economy country who do not have a separate rate will be covered by the review as part of the single entity of which the named firms are a part.</P>
          </FTNT>

          <P>Please note that, for any party the Department was unable to locate in prior segments, the Department will not accept a request for an administrative review of that party absent new information as to the party's location. Moreover, if the interested party who<PRTPAGE P="92"/>files a request for review is unable to locate the producer or exporter for which it requested the review, the interested party must provide an explanation of the attempts it made to locate the producer or exporter at the same time it files its request for review, in order for the Secretary to determine if the interested party's attempts were reasonable, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.303(f)(3)(ii).</P>
          <P>As explained in<E T="03">Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties,</E>68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003), the Department has clarified its practice with respect to the collection of final antidumping duties on imports of merchandise where intermediate firms are involved. The public should be aware of this clarification in determining whether to request an administrative review of merchandise subject to antidumping findings and orders.<E T="03">See also</E>the Import Administration Web site at<E T="03">http://ia.ita.doc.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>Six copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Room 1870, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. The Department also asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping/Countervailing Operations, Attention: Sheila Forbes, in room 3508 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.303(f)(3)(ii), a copy of each request must be served on the petitioner and each exporter or producer specified in the request.</P>
          <P>The Department will publish in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>a notice of “Initiation of Administrative Review of Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation” for requests received by the last day of January 2011. If the Department does not receive, by the last day of January 2011, a request for review of entries covered by an order, finding, or suspended investigation listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the CBP to assess antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.</P>
          <P>For the first administrative review of any order, there will be no assessment of antidumping or countervailing duties on entries of subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the relevant provisional-measures “gap” period, of the order, if such a gap period is applicable to the POR.</P>
          <P>This notice is not required by statute but is published as a service to the international trading community.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

          <P>On November 10, 2010, the Department of Commerce (“the Department”) initiated an investigation of multilayered wood flooring from the People's Republic of China (“PRC”).<E T="03">See Multilayered Wood Flooring From the People's Republic of China: Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation,</E>75 FR 70719 (November 18, 2010) (“<E T="03">Initiation Notice”</E>). Currently, the preliminary determination is due no later than January 14, 2011.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Postponement of Due Date for Preliminary Determination</HD>
          <P>Under section 703(c)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the “Act”), the Department may extend the period for reaching a preliminary determination in a countervailing duty investigation until no later than the 130th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation, if the Department determines that the parties are cooperating and additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination because the case is extraordinarily complicated. The Department solicited and received comments from parties, and concludes that concerned parties are cooperating. The Department further finds that additional time is required because the number of alleged manufacturers, producers, and exporters listed in the Petition<SU>1</SU>

            <FTREF/>has complicated the Department's selection of the firms to individually investigate.<E T="03">See</E>section 703(c)(1)(B)(i)(IV) of the Act.</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>Moreover, since the<E T="03">Initiation Notice,</E>the Department has concluded it cannot use U.S. Customs and Border Protection data for respondent selection. Rather, it is appropriate to solicit information about the quantity and value of subject merchandise sales from the firms named in the Petition. Therefore, respondent selection is extraordinarily complicated due to the large number of companies from which the Department is gathering quantity and value information. Thus, the Department is extending the due date for the preliminary determination to no later than 130 days after the day on which the investigation was initiated (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>March 20, 2011). However, March 20, 2011, falls on a Sunday, and it is the Department's long-standing practice to issue a determination the next business day when the statutory deadline falls on a weekend, Federal holiday, or any other day when the Department is closed.<E T="03">See Notice of Clarification: Application of “Next Business Day” Rule for Administrative Determination Deadlines Pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, As Amended,</E>70 FR 24533 (May 10, 2005). Accordingly, the deadline for completion of the preliminary determination is now no later than Monday, March 21, 2011.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Program Description:</E>NIST is one of the nation's premiere research institutions for the physical and engineering sciences and, as the lead Federal agency for technology transfer, it provides a strong interface between government, industry and academia. NIST embodies a science culture, developed from a large and well-equipped research staff that enthusiastically blends programs that address the immediate needs of industry with longer-term research that anticipates future needs. This occurs in few other places and enables the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), Engineering Laboratory (EL), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), and Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML), to offer unique research and training opportunities for undergraduates, providing them a research-rich environment and exposure to state of the art equipment.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Programs</E>are soliciting applications in the areas of physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, nanotechnology, neutron research, engineering, mathematics, and computer science as described in the Federal Funding Opportunity. The<E T="03">SURF NIST Boulder Programs</E>are soliciting applications in the areas of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, materials science, mathematics, and computer science as described in the Federal Funding Opportunity.</P>
        <P>Applications for the Gaithersburg and Boulder programs are separate. Application to one program does not constitute application to the other, and applications will not be exchanged between the Gaithersburg and Boulder programs. If applicants wish to be considered at both sites, two separate applications must be submitted.</P>
        <P>Both SURF programs provide an opportunity for the NIST laboratories and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to join in a partnership to encourage outstanding undergraduate students to pursue careers in science and engineering. The objective of the SURF programs is to build a mutually beneficial relationship among the student, the institution, and NIST. The programs are conducted in English and provide research opportunities for students to work with internationally known NIST scientists, to expose them to cutting-edge research and promote the pursuit of graduate degrees in science and engineering. It is expected that the students in the program will have a proficiency in writing and speaking English, the ability to live and work with others, a commitment to honesty, and an interest in learning new things and using their own innovativeness to develop new science. Safety is a top priority at NIST. Students participating in the SURF program will be expected to be safety-conscious, to attend NIST safety training, and to comply with all NIST safety policies and procedures.</P>
        <P>The<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg and Boulder Program</E>Directors will work with appropriate department chairs, outreach coordinators, and directors of multi-disciplinary academic organizations to identify outstanding undergraduates (including graduating seniors) who would benefit from off-campus summer research in a world-class scientific environment.</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Eligibility:</E>NIST's<E T="03">SURF Gaithersburg Programs</E>are open to colleges and universities in the United States and its territories with degree-granting programs in materials science, chemistry, nanoscale science, neutron research, engineering, computer science, mathematics, or physics. Participating students must be U.S. citizens or permanent U.S. residents.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Cost Sharing or Matching:</E>The<E T="03">SURF Gaithersburg Programs</E>do not require any cost sharing or matching funds.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Review and Selection Process:</E>All<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>proposals must be submitted in accordance with the instructions given in the Federal Funding Opportunity. All applications received in response to this announcement will be reviewed to determine whether or not they are complete and responsive to the scope of the stated objectives for each program. Incomplete or non-responsive applications will not be reviewed for technical merit. The Program will retain one copy of each non-responsive application for three years for record keeping purposes. The remaining copies will be destroyed.</P>
          <P>Proposals must include the required forms listed in the FFO, and the following information:</P>
          <P>(A) Student Information (student's name and university should appear on all of these documents):</P>
          <P>(1) Student application information cover sheet;</P>
          <P>(2) Academic transcript for each student nominated for participation (it is recommended that students have a G.P.A. of 3.0 or better, out of a possible 4.0);</P>
          <P>(3) A statement of motivation and commitment from each student to participate in the 2011 SURF Program, including a description of the student's prioritized research interests;</P>
          <P>(4) A resume for each student;</P>
          <P>(5) Two letters of recommendation for each student that should address paragraph (A) of the evaluation criteria below; and</P>
          <P>(6) Copy of passport, green card, or birth certificate as confirmation of U.S. citizenship or permanent legal resident status for each student.</P>
          <P>(B) Information About the Applicant Institution:</P>
          <P>(1) Description of the institution's education and research programs; and</P>
          <P>(2) A summary list of the student(s) being nominated.</P>

          <P>Institution proposals will be separated into student/institution packets. Each student/institution packet will be comprised of the required application forms, including a complete copy of the student information and a complete copy of the institution information. The student/institution packets will be directed to the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>or MML/NCNR Sub-program designated by the student as his/her first choice.</P>
          <P>The selection process occurs in three rounds. Each<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>will have three independent, objective NIST employees, who are knowledgeable in the scientific areas of the program, conduct a technical review of each student/institution packet based on the Evaluation Criteria for the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Programs</E>described in this notice. For the first round of evaluations and placement, each technical reviewer will evaluate according to the Evaluation Criteria listed below and provide a score for each student/institution packet. Based on the average of the reviewers' scores, a rank order of the student/institution packets will be prepared within each laboratory.</P>

          <P>The SURF Program Director (Selecting Official) for each program, who is a NIST program official who did not participate in the technical evaluations, will then apply the following Selection Factors, which may result in revisions to the rank order: relevance of the student's course of study to the program objectives of the NIST laboratory in which that<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>resides as described in the Program Description section of this notice and the corresponding Federal Funding Opportunity, the relevance of the student's statement of commitment to the goals of the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program,</E>fit of the student's interests and abilities to the available projects in that laboratory program, assessment of whether the laboratory experience is a new opportunity for the student which may encourage future postgraduate training, and the availability of funding.</P>

          <P>Based on these results, the Program Director (Selecting Official) for each laboratory program will divide the rank ordered student/institution packets into three categories: Priority Funding; Fund if Possible; and Do Not Fund. Student/institution packets placed in the Priority Funding category will be selected for funding in that<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program,</E>contingent upon availability of<PRTPAGE P="95"/>funds. Student/institution packets placed in the Do Not Fund category will not be considered for funding by any other<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program.</E>
          </P>

          <P>Student/institution packets placed in the Fund if Possible Category may be considered for funding at a later time by the category-designating<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program.</E>The “category-designating” program is the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>whose Program Director first categorized the applicant packet as “Priority Funding”, “Fund if Possible”, or “Do Not Fund.” This is the same<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>which was designated by the student in the application cover sheet as his/her first choice. In the interim, period these students will be released for consideration for funding by the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>designated by the student as his/her second choice. The student's second choice laboratory's SURF Program Director will take into consideration the recommendations of the reviewers who conducted the technical reviews for the student's first choice<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program,</E>apply the selection factors noted above as applied to that laboratory and arrive at a final rank order of the students available for the second round of selections and placements. Any<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>may choose not to participate in the second round, if the Program Director does not see suitable students in the second round appropriate for the available projects. Students not selected during the first or second round are available for the third round of selections.</P>

          <P>Students not selected for funding by their first or second choice<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program,</E>and students who did not designate a second choice, will then be considered for funding from all<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Programs</E>that still have slots available in a third round, using the same process as the second round. In making selections for the third round of selections and placement, each<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>Director (Selecting Official) will take into consideration the recommendations of the reviewers who conducted the technical reviews for the student's first choice<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program,</E>the selection factors noted above as applied to that laboratory, and the rank order of the students in this selection round. Any<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Program</E>may choose not to participate in the third round if there are no slots available. Substitutions for students who decline offers will be made from the remaining pool of ranked students consistent with the program review process.</P>
          <P>The final approval of selected applications and award of cooperative agreements will be made by the NIST Grants Officer based on compliance with application requirements as published in this notice and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements. NIST also reserves the right to reject an application where information is uncovered that reflects adversely on an applicant's business integrity, resulting in a determination by the Grants Officer that an applicant is not presently responsible. Applicants may be asked to modify objectives, work plans, or budgets and provide supplemental information required by the agency prior to award. The decision of the Grants Officer is final.</P>
          <P>The<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Programs</E>will retain one copy of each unsuccessful application for three years for recordkeeping purposes, and unsuccessful applicants will be notified in writing. The remaining copies will be destroyed.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Evaluation Criteria:</E>For the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Programs,</E>the evaluation criteria are:</P>
          <P>(A)<E T="03">Evaluation of Student's Interest in Participating in the Program, Academic Ability, Laboratory Experience and Advanced Degree Interest:</E>Evaluation of grade point average in courses relevant to the<E T="03">SURF NIST Gaithersburg Programs,</E>career goals, honors and awards, commitment of the student to working in a laboratory environment, and interest in pursuing graduate school.</P>

In addition, any proposal that includes research on these topics must be in compliance with any statutory requirements imposed upon the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other Federal agencies regarding these topics, all regulatory policies and guidance adopted by DHHS, the Food and Drug Administration, and other Federal agencies on these topics, and all Presidential statements of policy on these topics.</P>
          <P>NIST will accept the submission of human subjects protocols that have been approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) currently registered with DHHS and performed by entities possessing a current, valid Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) from DHHS, that are appropriately linked to the IRB that approved the protocol. NIST will not issue a single project assurance (SPA) for any IRB reviewing any human subjects protocol proposed to NIST.</P>
          <P>Generally, the NIST does not fund research involving human subjects in foreign countries. NIST will consider, however, the use of preexisting tissue, cells, or data from a foreign source on a limited basis if the following criteria are satisfied:</P>
          <P>1. The scientific source is considered unique,</P>
          <P>2. An equivalent source is unavailable within the United States,</P>
          <P>3. An alternative approach is not scientifically of equivalent merit, and</P>
          <P>4. The specific use qualifies for an exemption under the Common Rule.</P>
          <P>President Obama has issued Executive Order No. 13,505 (74 FR 10667, March 9, 2009), revoking previous Executive Orders and Presidential statements regarding the use of human embryonic stem cells in research. On July 30, 2009, President Obama issued a memorandum directing that agencies that support and conduct stem cell research adopt the “National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research” (NIH Guidelines), which became effective on July 7, 2009, “to the fullest extent practicable in light of legal authorities and obligations.” On September 21, 2009, the Department of Commerce submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a statement of compliance with the NIH Guidelines. In accordance with the President's memorandum, the NIH Guidelines, and the Department of Commerce statement of compliance, NIST will support and conduct research using only human embryonic stem cell lines that have been approved by NIH in accordance with the NIH Guidelines and will review such research in accordance with the Common Rule and NIST implementing procedures, as appropriate. NIST will not support or conduct any type of research that the NIH Guidelines prohibit NIH from funding. NIST will follow any additional policies or guidance issued by the current Administration on this topic.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P>The Golden Crab FMP relies on a system of traditional fishery management plus limited access. Traditional fishery management includes: measures to provide biological protection to the resource (escape gaps in traps and no retention of female crabs); gear regulations (allowable gear, requirement for degradable panel, tending requirements, gear identification, and maximum trap size by zone); depth limitations and prohibition of possession of whole fish or fillets of snapper-grouper species; data collection requirements (vessel/fishermen and dealer/processor reporting); and a framework procedure to adjust the management program.</P>
        <P>The golden crab fishery resource is not overfished or undergoing overfishing. However, there are underlying social and economic problems resulting from gear conflicts, high regulatory costs, and limited markets. To solve these social and economic problems, managers have increasingly turned to various forms of controlled access or effort limitation. Combining more traditional fishery management measures with controlled access has allowed the Council to solve problems in the golden crab fishery.</P>
        <P>The Council is considering development and implementation of a catch share program for golden crab in order to: avoid a derby fishery from developing; place limitations on vessel harvest similar to historical participation; and maintain fishermen harvesting flexibility. Recent information indicates increased participation and renewed interest in participation in the golden crab fishery due to technological improvements that have increased quality, price, and marketability of golden crab.</P>
        <P>NMFS, in collaboration with the Council, will develop an EIS to describe and analyze management alternatives to address the management needs described above. Those alternatives will include a “no action” alternative regarding each action.</P>

        <P>In accordance with NOAA's Administrative Order 216-6, Section 5.02(c), Scoping Process, NMFS, in collaboration with the Council, has identified preliminary environmental issues as a means to initiate discussion<PRTPAGE P="99"/>for scoping purposes only. These preliminary issues may not represent the full range of issues that eventually will be evaluated in the EIS.</P>

        <P>Copies of an information packet will be available from NMFS (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>).</P>

        <P>Following publication of this NOI, the Council will conduct public scoping meetings to determine the range of issues to be addressed in the draft EIS (DEIS) and the associated Amendment 5. After the DEIS associated with Amendment 5 is completed, it will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DEIS for public comment in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The DEIS will have a 45-day comment period. This procedure is pursuant to regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; 40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and to NOAA's Administrative Order 216-6 regarding NOAA's compliance with NEPA and the CEQ regulations.</P>

        <P>The Council will consider public comments received on the DEIS in developing the final environmental impact statement (FEIS), and before voting to submit the final amendment to NMFS for Secretarial review, approval, and implementation. NMFS will announce in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>the availability of the final amendment and FEIS for public review during the Secretarial review period, and will consider all public comments prior to final agency action to approve, disapprove, or partially approve the final amendment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scoping Meetings, Times, and Locations</HD>

        <P>All meetings will begin at 3 p.m. In addition to Amendment 5, the Council intends to scope additional amendments at this series of meetings. Separate NOIs will be prepared for each amendment. The meetings will be physically accessible to people with disabilities.

        <P>The red grouper stock in the south Atlantic was assessed through the Southeast, Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) process in 2010. The assessment indicates that the stock is experiencing overfishing and is overfished. Overfishing is a condition when fishing pressure is beyond the allowable level. Overfishing may lead to an overfished condition. A stock is overfished when the biomass is below an identified minimum stock size threshold. Due to low biomass levels, an overfished stock has increased vulnerability to environmental variables and cannot produce the MSY.</P>

        <P>As directed by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Council and NMFS must implement a rebuilding plan, through an FMP Amendment or proposed regulations, which ends overfishing immediately and provides for rebuilding the fishery. The intent of a rebuilding plan is to increase biomass of overfished stocks to a sustainable level within a specified period of time. A plan should achieve conservation goals, while minimizing to the extent practicable adverse socioeconomic impacts. NMFS notified the Council of the stock status on June 9, 2010; the Magnuson-Stevens Act<PRTPAGE P="100"/>specifies that measures to end overfishing and rebuild the stock must be implemented within two years of notification.</P>
        <P>A reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 2007 introduced new tools that, when implemented, would end and prevent overfishing in order to achieve the OY from a fishery. The requirements are referred to as ACLs and AMs. An ACL is the level of annual catch of a stock that, if met or exceeded, triggers some corrective action. AMs are management controls to prevent ACLs from being exceeded and to correct overages of ACLs if they occur. Two examples of AMs include an in-season closure if catch approaches the ACL and reducing the ACL by an overage that occurred the previous fishing year. The EIS will include alternatives that would establish ACLs and AMs for red grouper in the South Atlantic region.</P>
        <P>The Council and NMFS are also considering a division of the red grouper ACL into sector-ACLs based upon allocation decisions. A “sector” means a distinct user group to which separate management strategies and separate catch quotas apply. Examples of sectors include commercial and recreational; the recreational sector may also be divided into for-hire and private recreational groups. The Council and NMFS have determined that sector-ACLs and sector-AMs are important components of red grouper management as each sector differs in scientific and management uncertainty. A range of options will be evaluated in the EIS, including those that base allocation decisions on historical landings.</P>
        <P>NMFS, in collaboration with the Council, will develop an EIS to describe and analyze alternatives to address the management needs described above. Those alternatives will include a “no action” alternative for each action.</P>
        <P>In accordance with NOAA's Administrative Order 216-6, Section 5.02(c), Scoping Process, NMFS, in collaboration with the Council, has identified preliminary environmental issues as a means to initiate discussion for scoping purposes only. These preliminary issues may not represent the full range of issues that eventually will be evaluated in the EIS.</P>

        <P>Copies of an information packet will be available from NMFS (<E T="03">see</E>
          <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>).</P>

        <P>After the draft EIS (DEIS) associated with Amendment 24 is completed, it will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DEIS for public comment in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The draft EIS will have a 45-day comment period. This procedure is pursuant to regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; 40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and to NOAA's Administrative Order 216-6 regarding NOAA's compliance with NEPA and the CEQ regulations.</P>

        <P>Following publication of this NOI, the Council will conduct public scoping meetings to determine the range of issues to be addressed in the DEIS and the associated Amendment 24. A<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice will announce the availability of the DEIS associated with this amendment, as well as a 45-day public comment period.

        <P>Currently, nine snapper-grouper stocks are undergoing overfishing and five stocks are overfished. The Council and NMFS have implemented numerous regulatory changes in recent years in an effort to end and prevent overfishing and rebuild depleted snapper-grouper stocks. These regulatory measures have resulted in decreases to commercial quotas for several species, which has lead to derby fishing conditions. As a result, the length of time it takes for the quota for some species (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, golden tilefish, vermilion snapper, and black sea bass) to be reached, has decreased significantly, resulting in lengthy commercial sector closures.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that, under status quo management, incentives for derby behavior will persist in the snapper-grouper fishery, resulting in continued overcapitalization and derby fishery conditions. The fishery is expected to continue to be characterized by higher than necessary levels of capital investment, increased operating costs, increased likelihood of shortened seasons, reduced at-sea safety, wide fluctuations in domestic snapper-grouper supply and depressed ex-vessel prices, which may lead to deteriorating working conditions and lower profitability for participants.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, the Council is considering several management approaches for limiting effort in the snapper grouper fishery, including: trip limits, endorsements, cooperatives, catch shares, regional quotas, and State-by-State quotas.</P>
        <P>An NOI was previously published on January 22, 2008 (73 FR 3701) to develop an EIS for Amendment 18 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP to consider alternatives to establish a limited access privilege program for the snapper-grouper fishery. However, the Council postponed consideration of this action to a future amendment.</P>
        <P>NMFS, in collaboration with the Council will develop an EIS to describe and analyze management alternatives to address the management needs described above. Those alternatives will include a “no action” alternative regarding each action.</P>
        <P>In accordance with NOAA's Administrative Order 216-6, Section 5.02(c), Scoping Process, NMFS, in collaboration with the Council, has identified preliminary environmental issues as a means to initiate discussion for scoping purposes only.

        <P>The red snapper stock in the South Atlantic was assessed through the Southeast, Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) process in 2008 and 2010. The assessments indicate that the stock is experiencing overfishing and is overfished. Overfishing is a condition when fishing pressure is beyond the allowable level. Overfishing may lead to an overfished condition. A stock is overfished when the biomass is below an identified minimum stock size threshold. Due to low biomass levels, an overfished stock has increased vulnerability to environmental variables and cannot produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield.</P>
        <P>As a result of the 2008 assessment, fishing for red snapper was prohibited temporarily through an interim rule from January 4, 2010, to December 5, 2010, to enable the Council to develop measures to end overfishing in Amendment 17A to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic region (Amendment 17A). Prior regulations included a recreational bag limit of 2 fish per person per day and a 20 inch total length minimum size limit for both commercial and recreational fishermen. Amendment 17A was submitted to the Secretary of Commerce on July 20, 2010, and approved on October 27, 2010. Measures in Amendment 17A included the continuation of the red snapper closure harvest prohibition established through the interim rule.</P>
        <P>NMFS, in collaboration with the Council, is considering alternatives to eliminate harvest restrictions on red snapper as the stock increases in biomass. Examples of measures under consideration include the implementation of red snapper trip limits, bag limits, a catch share program, tag program, temporal and spatial closures including those to protect spawning stocks, and gear prohibitions. These preliminary measures may not represent the full range of alternatives that eventually will be evaluated in the EIS.</P>

        <P>The Gulf of Mexico, South Atlantic, and Caribbean Fishery Management Councils, in conjunction with NOAA Fisheries and the Atlantic and Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commissions have implemented the Southeast Data, Assessment and Review (SEDAR) process, a multi-step method for determining the status of fish stocks in the Southeast Region. SEDAR is a three-step process including: (1) Data Workshop, (2) Assessment Process utilizing webinars and (3) Review Workshop. The product of the Data Workshop is a data report which compiles and evaluates potential datasets and recommends which datasets are appropriate for assessment analyses. The product of the Assessment Process is a stock assessment report which describes the fisheries, evaluates the status of the stock, estimates biological benchmarks, projects future population conditions, and recommends research and monitoring needs. The assessment is independently peer reviewed at the Review Workshop. The product of the Review Workshop is a Summary documenting Panel opinions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the stock assessment and input data. Participants for SEDAR Workshops are appointed by the Gulf of Mexico, South Atlantic, and Caribbean Fishery Management Councils and NOAA Fisheries Southeast Regional Office and Southeast Fisheries Science Center. Participants include data collectors and database managers; stock assessment scientists, biologists, and researchers; constituency representatives including fishermen, environmentalists, and NGO's; International experts; and staff of Councils, Commissions, and State and Federal agencies.</P>

          <P>The Western Area Power Administration (Western) is proposing new and revised formula rates and information for the following: Western power, the Central Valley Project (CVP) transmission, the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) transmission, the Pacific Alternating Current Intertie (PACI) transmission, ancillary services, custom product power, and information on Path 15 transmission upgrade. In addition to these existing rates for services, Western also is proposing to implement two new rates and services: Unreserved Use Penalties and Generator Imbalance Services (GI).<PRTPAGE P="128"/>
          </P>
          <P>Western is not proposing any changes to its existing formula rate methodologies. The proposed rates will provide sufficient revenue to pay all annual costs including interest expense, investments, and aid to irrigation within the allowable time periods. Western's rate brochure providing detailed information on the proposed formula rates will be available January 11, 2011, to all interested parties upon request.</P>
          <P>The current rates for existing services expire on September 30, 2011.<SU>1</SU>

            <FTREF/>If approved, the proposed rates would become effective on October 1, 2011, and remain in effect through September 30, 2016, or until superseded by another rate schedule. Publication of this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice begins the formal process for the proposed rate adjustments.</P>

        <P>This<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice initiates the formal public process to replace the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) approved rate schedules effective beginning January 1, 2005, ending September 30, 2011.</P>
        <P>The following discussion provides an overview of the proposed formula rates and components, including a rate comparison, rate recovery, and applicability. Western held 14 public Informal Rate meetings beginning June 2008 through April 2010. Based on stakeholders' comments and Western's analysis, Western is not proposing any changes to existing rate methodologies. Western proposes adding new rate schedules for unreserved use penalties and generator imbalance services. Western will continue to operate as a Sub-Balancing Authority (SBA) under contract with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, who operates the Host Balancing Authority (HBA).</P>
        <P>Prior to the start of each fiscal year (FY), Western will calculate and publish an annual Power Revenue Requirement (PRR) to determine the total cost of power to be allocated to preference customers. For example, by October 1, 2011, Western will publish the PRR for FY 2012, which begins October 1, 2011, and ends September 30, 2012. As part of the rate development, Western prepares a Power Repayment Study (PRS) each FY to determine if revenue will be sufficient to repay, within the required time periods, all costs assigned to the commercial power function. Repayment criteria are based on legislation and applicable policies, including DOE Order RA 6120.2. Generally, the PRR includes operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenses, purchased power for Project Use and First Preference (FP) customers' loads, interest and other expenses (including any other statutorily-required costs or charges), investment repayment, and the Washoe Project annual PRR that remains after project use loads are met. Revenues from project use, transmission, ancillary services, and other services are offset against expenses in the PRR; and the remainder is collected from Base Resource (BR) and FP customers. The PRR is reviewed during March of each year; and if such review results in a change of $5 million or more, the PRR is adjusted for the remaining 6-month period. The PRR is an estimate of revenues and costs including investment and repayment projections from the PRS. Any deviation from estimate to actual will increase or decrease annual project repayment. Project repayment is measured over the long term to ensure repayment is met and to maintain rate stability.</P>
        <P>The PRR is allocated to Western's preference customers, namely, FP customers based on their FP percentages, and the remaining amount to BR customers based on their BR allocation, adjusted for programs, such as, hourly exchange. The Trinity River Division Act of 1955 (69 Stat. 719) and the Flood Control Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 1173, 1191-1192) accorded first preference to CVP power to customers in Trinity, Tuolumne, and Calaveras Counties. A BR customer, under the 2004 Marketing Plan, is an entity that has executed a BR contract and is allocated a percentage of the BR.</P>
        <P>In order for Western to meet the load requirements, beyond delivered BR, for Full Load Service (FLS) customers and Variable Resource (VR) customers, Western may make supplemental power (SP) purchases, pursuant to the Custom Product Power (CPP) rate schedule. FLS and VR customers who contract with Western for such service will pay all SP costs. FLS customers pay a portfolio management charge pursuant to their contract, whereas VR customers pay a scheduling charge pursuant to the proposed rate schedule.</P>
        <P>At least annually, Western will publish the CVP transmission rates for point-to-point and network integration transmission service, the seasonal COTP and PACI transmission rates, and CVP regulation and frequency response service rates. Western prepares a detailed cost-of-service study to determine the costs, by project, that support the transfer capability of each transmission system and the costs that support the generation capability of the CVP system. Generally, the costs allocated through the cost-of-service study for the transmission systems include O&amp;M, interest, and depreciation expenses. Western's costs for scheduling, system control and dispatch service associated with CVP, COTP, and PACI transmission service are included and recovered through the respective transmission system's RR. Third-party transmission service costs are passed through directly to each requesting customer.</P>

        <P>Spinning and supplemental reserves are charged the price consistent with the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) market price plus all costs incurred for the sale of these reserves. Customers who have a<PRTPAGE P="129"/>contractual obligation to provide spinning and supplemental reserves and do not fulfill their obligation will be assessed a penalty equal to the greater of Western's actual cost or 150 percent of the market price. Similarly, for Energy Imbalance (EI) service, customers outside of their contractual bandwidth (under delivery) will pay the greater of 150 percent of the market price or Western's actual cost. Given Western's EI customers are and will continue to operate under existing agreements, Western will continue its existing rate methodology for EI. During the applicable rate period, Western will review FERC Order No. 890<E T="03">pro forma</E>approach, as well as Western's existing settlements and billing processes and will reconsider a transition to FERC's<E T="03">pro forma</E>tariff methodology during Western's next rate process or earlier if deemed appropriate.</P>
        <P>Finally, based on the requirements under FERC's Order No. 890, Western proposes adding two new rate schedules to be effective during the new rate period: Unreserved Use Penalties and GI. Western proposes the Unreserved Use Penalties be assessed at 150 percent of the effective point-to-point transmission rate when transmission service is used and not reserved or when used in excess of reservation. Western proposes the GI rate use the same tiered methodology as Western's existing and proposed EI service rate and any subsequent changes. Note, currently Western has no customers subject to this proposed GI rate.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Information on Path 15 Transmission Upgrade</HD>
        <P>The Path 15 Transmission Upgrade was completed in 2005. Western has turned over the operational control of Western's Path 15 Upgrade to the CAISO. Western maintains the lines and is compensated by Atlantic Path 15, LLC for the Operation and Maintenance work costs. The CAISO charges for use on the Path 15 Upgrade as part of its rates. Western does not charge a separate rate for Path 15. Western collects revenues from the CAISO under its agreements with the CAISO. Under Amendment No. 48, the CAISO remits to Western, wheeling, congestion, and Congestion Revenue Rights revenues associated with Western's rights on the Path 15 transmission.<SU>2</SU>

The PRR for the April-through-September period will be reviewed in March of each year. The review will analyze financial data from the October-through-February period, to the extent information is available, as well as forecasted data for the March-through-September period. If there is a change of $5 million or more, the PRR for the April-through-September period will be recalculated. The PRR is allocated to FP and BR customers based on the formula rates.</P>

        <P>The percentages in the table below are the maximum percentages for each FP customer that will be effective to the MRR during the rate period October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2016. The maximum percentages were determined based on a critically dry year where there are hydrologic conditions that result in low CVP generation and, consequently, low levels of BR. An FP<PRTPAGE P="130"/>percentage cannot exceed the maximum except in instances where individual FP customer percentages increase due to load growth. If these maximum percentages are used for determining the FP customer's charges for more than 1 year, Western will evaluate their percentage from the formula rate versus the maximum percentage and make adjustments as appropriate.</P>

        <P>The formula rates for CVP FP power and BR power are based on a PRR that recovers: (1) O&amp;M expense allocated to power; (2) CVP network transmission; (3) annual investment and replacement repayment; (4) aid-to-irrigation costs; (5) interest expense; (6) power purchases for firming BR; (7) Washoe project annual costs after project use loads are met; (8) other miscellaneous expenses allocated to power, such as, settlements, California-Oregon Intertie (COI) path operator costs,<E T="03">etc.;</E>(9) the pass through of FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits; (10) the pass through of the HBA's charges or credits; (11) any other statutorily-required costs or charges; and (12) any other costs associated with BR or FP power service including uncollectible debt.</P>
        <P>Expenses are offset by revenues from project use energy, transmission revenue, ancillary service revenue, scheduling coordinator, portfolio management and VR charge administrative fees, all pass through revenue, and any other miscellaneous revenue.</P>
        <P>The PRR will be allocated first to FP customers based on their percentages, subject to the maximum cap, then the remaining amount to BR customers based on their BR allocation percentages, adjusted for programs, such as, HE if applicable.</P>
        <P>The BR RR will be collected in two, 6-month periods: 25 percent for October through March and 75 percent for April through September. However, the FP RR is not subject to the 25/75 percent split; and it will be collected evenly over a 12-month period.</P>

        <P>The formula rates will be effective at the beginning of each FY and reviewed in March of each year. If the March mid-year review reflects a change of $5 million or more, the annual PRR will be revised. The FP percentages are also reviewed at mid-year. If the mid-year<PRTPAGE P="132"/>review reflects a change to a FP customer's percentage of more than one half of one percent, that customer's percentage will be revised for the remainder of the FY.</P>
        <P>The formula rates apply to CVP BR and FP power customers. The estimated rates are subject to change prior to the rates taking effect. The rates will be finalized by Western on or before October 1, 2011.</P>

The methodology used to calculate the amount of the pass through will be based on the type of funding used to purchase the CPP. The CPP includes, but is not limited to, SP and BR firming power. If in the event customer advance funding is used to purchase CPP, then allocation of surplus CPP sales will be determined based on customer's account status.</P>
        <P>If the CPP is funded through appropriations, Federal reimbursable, or use of receipts authority, the cost of the CPP is passed through to the customer(s) for whom Western has made the purchase. The CPP funded through appropriations, Federal reimbursable, or use of receipts authority that is surplus to the load requirements of the customer(s) will be sold. Proceeds from the sale of surplus CPP funded through use of receipts, Federal reimbursable, or appropriations authority will be applied to the CPP purchase cost for the customer(s) to the extent possible. If the cost of the CPP is fully recovered and proceeds remain from the sale of surplus CPP, the remaining proceeds will be used to reduce the PRR.</P>
        <P>The table below illustrates the pass through of the CPP costs to each customer and the treatment of proceeds from the sale of surplus CPP funded through appropriations, Federal reimbursable, or use of receipts authority. As shown below, Customers A, B, and C are responsible for paying the full costs of the CPP purchase made by Western (total CPP RR is $780). The CPP RR of $780 is reduced by the sale of 1 MWh at $45, which reduces the CPP RR to $735. Therefore, the reduced CPP RR of $735 is prorated to each customer based on the amount of CPP purchased on their behalf.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Applicable:</E>To transmission customers using transmission not reserved or in excess of reservation.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Character and Conditions of Service:</E>Transmission service for three-phase, alternating current at 60 hertz, delivered and metered at the voltages and points of delivery or receipt, adjusted for losses, and delivered to points of delivery. This service includes scheduling and system control and dispatch service needed to support the transmission service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary</HD>
        <P>Western proposes to add a penalty rate for unreserved use of transmission for the CVP, COTP, and PACI in a new rate schedule, Rate Schedule CV-UUP1.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Penalty Rate</HD>
        <P>The rate for Unreserved Use Penalties service is 150 percent of the approved transmission service rate for point-to-point transmission service assessed as described above, plus 100 percent of the approved ancillary service rates if applicable.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Component 1:</E>Unreserved Use Penalties service is provided when a transmission customer uses transmission service that it has not reserved or uses transmission service in excess of its reserved capacity. A transmission customer that has not secured reserved capacity or exceeds its firm or non-firm reserved capacity at any point of receipt or any point of delivery will be assessed Unreserved Use Penalties.</P>

        <P>The penalty charge for a transmission customer who engages in unreserved use is 150 percent of Western's approved transmission service rate for point-to-point transmission service assessed as follows: (1) The Unreserved Use Penalty for a single hour of unreserved use will be based upon the rate for daily firm point-to-point service; (2) the Unreserved Use Penalty for more than one assessment for a given duration (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>daily) will increase to the next longest duration (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>weekly); and (3) the Unreserved Use Penalty for multiple instances of unreserved use (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>more than 1 hour) within a day will be based on the rate for daily firm point-to-point service. The penalty charge for multiple instances of unreserved use isolated to 1 calendar week would result in a penalty based on the charge for weekly firm point-to-point service. The penalty charge for multiple instances of unreserved use during more than 1 week within a calendar month is based on the charge for monthly firm point-to-point service.</P>
        <P>Unreserved Use Penalties will not apply to transmission customers utilizing point-to-point transmission service under Western's OATT as a result of action taken to support reliability. Such actions include reserve activations or uncontrolled event response as directed by the responsible reliability authority such as SBA, HBA Reliability Coordinator, or Transmission Operator.</P>
        <P>A transmission customer that exceeds its firm or non-firm reserved capacity is required to pay for all ancillary services identified in Western's OATT associated with the unreserved use of transmission service. The transmission customer or eligible customer will pay for ancillary services based on the amount of transmission service it used but did not reserve. No penalty will be applied to the ancillary service charges.</P>
        <P>Unreserved Use Penalties collected over and above the base firm or non-firm point-to-point charge will be distributed to customers as a credit on future TRRs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Component 2:</E>Any charges or credits associated with the creation, termination, or modification to any tariff, contract, or rate schedule accepted or approved by FERC or other regulatory body will be passed on to each relevant customer. The FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits apply to the service to which this rate methodology applies. When possible, Western will pass through directly to the relevant customer FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits in the same manner Western is charged or credited. If FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits cannot be passed through directly to the relevant customer in the same manner Western is charged or credited, the charges or credits will be passed through using Component 1 of the penalty rate.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Component 3:</E>Any charges or credits from the HBA applied to Western for providing this service will be passed through directly to the relevant customer in the same manner Western is charged or credited to the extent possible. If the HBA's costs or credits cannot be passed through to the relevant customer in the same manner Western is charged or credited, the charges or credits will be passed through using Component 1 of the penalty rate.</P>

        <P>This is a new rate schedule effective October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2016.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rate Recovery and Applicability</HD>
        <P>The rate recovers the cost of transmission and applies a penalty for such unreserved use. The revenue resulting from the penalty portion will be distributed as a credit to the relevant TRRs. The penalty rate is applicable for all unreserved use of transmission and transmission in excess of reservation except, as may be determined by Western, in emergencies or reserve sharing activations. Western will provide written notification 30 days in advance to its transmission customers prior to implementing this penalty rate and will also post a notification on its OASIS Web site indicating the implementation of Unreserved Use Penalties.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rate Recovery and Application</HD>
        <P>The spinning reserve charge is calculated for each hour during the month in order to derive the total monthly charge. The proposed formula rate for spinning reserve service is as follows: (1) A price consistent with the CAISO's market price; (2) all costs incurred as a result of the sale of spinning reserves, such as Western's scheduling costs; (3) the cost of energy, capacity, or generation that supports spinning reserve service; (4) the pass through of FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits; (5) the pass through of the HBA's charges or credits; and (6) any other statutorily required costs or charges. For customers that have a contractual obligation to provide spinning reserve to Western and do not fulfill that obligation, the penalty for non-performance is the greater of actual cost or 150 percent of the market price.</P>
        <P>The cost for spinning reserve required to firm CVP generation for the current hour and the following hour is included in the PRR. Spinning reserves surplus to those required to support the SBA and firm CVP generation may be sold. Surplus spinning reserves will be sold at prices consistent with the CAISO markets. Revenues from the sale of surplus spinning reserves will offset the PRR. The spinning reserve formula rate will apply to SBA customers who contract with Western to provide this service.</P>

        <P>Western is proposing to maintain its existing tier methodology for EI. While FERC Order No. 890 defines a three-tier methodology, it allows alternatives to<E T="03">pro forma</E>design if the rate schedule follows the intent of the three principles: (1) Charges based on incremental cost or some multiple thereof; (2) charges must provide incentive for accurate scheduling; and (3) provisions address intermittent renewable resources (wind/solar) limited forecasting abilities by waiver of the most punitive penalties.</P>
        <P>Western's existing EI rate schedule follows the intent by: (1) Charges under a tiered methodology where, within the bandwidth, energy is exchanged, over deliveries are lost to the system, and under deliveries are charged the greater of 150 percent of the CAISO market price or Western's actual cost; (2) penalties outside the bandwidth also provide incentives for good scheduling practices; and (3) to the extent that an entity incorporates intermittent resources, Western proposes eliminating the 150 percent of market price factor for under deliveries. Western will charge the greater of market price or Western's actual cost.</P>

        <P>Given that Western's customers will be operating under existing agreements during the applicable rate period, Western will review FERC Order No. 890<E T="03">pro forma</E>approach, as well as Western's existing settlements and billing processes and will consider a transition to FERC's<E T="03">pro forma</E>tariff methodology during Western's next rate process or earlier if deemed appropriate.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, for deviations outside of the bandwidth, the EI service charge is recovered using the greater of 150 percent of the market price or Western's actual cost. The actual cost is calculated using CVP generation RR and associated energy. Additional costs subject to recovery include HBA's charges or credits, FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits, and any other statutorily-required costs or charges.</P>
        <P>The EI service charge will be recovered from SBA customers that have contracted with Western for this service. The revenues from EI service will be applied to the PRR. Since the actual cost is calculated based on Western's cost of generation, it is subject to change prior to the effective rate period.</P>

          <E T="03">Applicable:</E>To generators receiving GI.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Character and Conditions of Service:</E>GI is provided when a difference occurs between the scheduled and actual delivery of energy from an eligible generation resource within the SBA, over an hour, or in accordance with approved policies and procedures. The deviation in MW is the net scheduled amount of generation minus the net metered output from the generator's (actual generation) amount.</P>
        <P>GI is subject to the deviation bandwidth to be established in the service agreement or IOA.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Formula Rate:</E>The formula rate for the GI has three components:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Component 1:</E>GI is applied to deviations as follows: (1) For deviations within the bandwidth, there will be no financial settlement; rather, GI will be tracked and settled with energy; (2) negative deviations (under delivery), outside the deviation bandwidth, will be charged the greater of 150 percent of market price or actual cost; and (3)<PRTPAGE P="141"/>positive deviations (over delivery), outside the deviation bandwidth, will be lost to the system.</P>
        <P>Deviations which occur as a result of actions taken to support reliability will be resolved in accordance with existing contractual requirements. Such actions include reserve activations or uncontrolled event responses as directed by the responsible reliability authority such as SBA, HBA, Reliability Coordinator, or Transmission Operator.</P>
        <P>To the extent that an entity incorporates intermittent resources, deviations will be charged as follows: (1) For deviations within the bandwidth, there will be no financial settlement; rather, GI will be tracked and settled with energy; (2) negative deviations (under delivery), outside the deviation bandwidth, will be charged the greater of market price or actual cost; and (3) positive deviations (over delivery), outside the deviation bandwidth, will be lost to the system.</P>

The FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits apply to the service to which this rate methodology applies. When possible, Western will pass through directly to the relevant customer FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits in the same manner Western is charged or credited. If FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits cannot be passed through directly to the relevant customer in the same manner Western is charged or credited, the charges or credits will be passed through using Component 1 of the formula rate.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rate Recovery and Application</HD>

        <P>Western is proposing to adopt its existing EI methodology for GI. Similar to EI, FERC Order No. 890 defines a three-tier methodology for GI. The order allows alternatives to<E T="03">pro forma</E>design if the rate schedule follows the intent of the three principles: (1) Charges based on incremental cost or some multiple thereof; (2) charges must provide incentive for good scheduling practice; and (3) provisions address intermittent renewable resources (wind/solar) to waive punitive penalties.</P>
        <P>Similar to Western's existing EI rate schedule, GI will follow the intent by: (1) Charges under a tiered methodology; where, within the bandwidth, energy is exchanged, over deliveries are lost to the system, and under deliveries are charged the greater of 150 percent of the CAISO market price or Western's actual cost; (2) penalties outside the bandwidth also provide incentives for good scheduling practices; and (3) to the extent that an entity incorporates intermittent resources, Western proposes eliminating the 150 percent of market price factor for under deliveries. Western will charge the greater of market price or Western's actual cost.</P>

        <P>Currently, Western has no existing customers under GI. Western will review FERC Order No. 890<E T="03">pro forma</E>approach, as well as Western's existing settlements and billing processes and will consider a transition to FERC's<E T="03">pro forma</E>tariff methodology during Western's next rate process or earlier if deemed appropriate.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, for deviations outside of the bandwidth, the GI charge is recovered using the greater of 150 percent of the market price or Western's actual cost. The actual cost is calculated using CVP generation RR and associated energy. Additional costs subject to recovery include HBA's charges or credits, FERC's or other regulatory body's accepted or approved charges or credits, and any other statutorily required costs or charges.</P>
        <P>The GI charge will be recovered from SBA customers that have contracted with Western for this service. The revenues from GI will be applied to the PRR. Since the actual cost is calculated based on Western's cost of generation, it is subject to change prior to the effective rate period.</P>
        <P>Below is an example of how the GI charge is calculated using Component 1.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Notice of a Regional Project Waiver of Section 1605 (Buy American) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to the Town of Smyrna, DE</SUBJECT>
        <SUM>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">SUMMARY:</HD>

          <P>The EPA is hereby granting a waiver of the Buy American Requirements of ARRA Section 1605 under the authority of Section 1605(b)(2) [manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality] to the Town of Smyrna, DE (“Town”), for the purchase of GreensandPlus pressure filter media, manufactured in Brazil, for six pressure filters. This is a project specific waiver and only applies to the use of the specified product for the ARRA project being proposed. Any<PRTPAGE P="143"/>other ARRA recipient that wishes to use the same product must apply for a separate waiver based on project specific circumstances. The Town evaluated eight different types of pressure filter media selecting GreensandPlus filter media. The ARRA funded project is for Well House upgrades that include filter media replacement, two filters in Well House #1, two filters in Well House #2 and two filters in Well House #3 in the Smyrna system. If an alternate domestic filter media were to be installed in the six pressure filters, the Town's system would experience increased backwash requirements, reduced capacity and would need modifications/replacement of underdrain and filter piping. Based upon information submitted by the Town and its consulting engineer, EPA has concluded that there are no filter media manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonable quantity and of a satisfactory quality to meet the technical specifications and that a waiver of the Buy American provisions is justified. The Regional Administrator is making this determination based on the review and recommendations of the EPA Region III, Water Protection Division, Office of Infrastructure and Assistance.</P>
          <P>The Assistant Administrator of the Office of Administration and Resources Management has concurred on this decision to make an exception to the requirements of Section 1605(a) of ARRA. This action permits the purchase of GreensandPlus pressure filter media for the proposed project being implemented by the Town of Smyrna.</P>

        <P>In accordance with ARRA Section 1605(c), the EPA hereby provides notice that it is granting a project waiver of the requirements of Section 1605(a) of Public Law 111-5, Buy American requirements, to the Town of Smyrna, Delaware for the purchase of non-domestic GreensandPlus pressure filter media for six pressure filters. EPA has evaluated the Town's basis for procuring the GreensandPlus pressure filter media for these filters. Based upon information submitted by the Town and its consulting engineer, EPA has concluded that there are no filter media manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonable quantity and of a satisfactory quality to meet the technical specifications for the Town to pursue the purchase of domestically manufactured filter media.</P>
        <P>Section 1605 of the ARRA requires that none of the appropriated funds may be used for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or a public works project unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project is produced in the United States, or unless a waiver is provided to the recipient by the head of the appropriate agency, here the EPA. A waiver may be provided under Section 1605(b) if EPA determines that (1) applying these requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) inclusion of iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.</P>
        <P>EPA has determined that Town's waiver request may be treated as timely even though the request was made after the construction contract was signed. Consistent with the direction of the OMB Guidance at 2 CFR 176.120, EPA has evaluated the Town's request to determine if the request, though made after the contract date, can be treated as if it were timely made. EPA will generally regard waiver requests with respect to components that were specified in the bid solicitation or in a general/primary construction contract as “late” if submitted after the contract date. However, in this case EPA has determined that the Town's request may be treated as timely because the need for a waiver was not foreseeable at the time the contract was signed. The project was bid and the general contractor submitted documentation that Greensand filter media utilized in preparing their bid met the ARRA Buy American provisions. The need for a waiver was not determined until after the contract was signed, when the contractor was informed by the manufacturer of Greensand that they were no longer making this product and recommended the GreensandPlus pressure filter media as an alternative product. They then were notified that the GreensandPlus pressure filter media was made in Brazil. Accordingly, EPA will evaluate the request as a timely request.</P>
        <P>The Town is requesting a waiver of the Buy American provision for the GreensandPlus filter media for six pressure filters. The Town has three well houses that each contains two pressure filters for their water treatment system. The project involves the replacement of standard manganese greensand in three well houses. The Town provided supporting documentation that the manufacturer, Inversand Company (Inversand), has temporarily shut down production of manganese greensand. Inversand advised its customers to instead use its GreensandPlus filter media, which is manufactured in Brazil, as an alternative product. The Town has stated that GreensandPlus filter media is compatible with existing treatment facilities, and the use of GreensandPlus filter media is expected to reduce overall operational costs. Detailed evaluation of all of the submitted documentation by EPA Region III, Office of Infrastructure and Assistance, and EPA's national contractor indicates that the Town did not know that the GreensandPlus filter media was made in Brazil until after the project was awarded. In addition, submitted documentation showed that the Town would require replacement/modification of the existing underdrain and associated filter piping if any of the other filter media were used in the project. Due to the existing backwash piping configuration, a lower backwash rate is needed which could be attained by the GreensandPlus filter media without replacement of the underdrain or piping. The GreensandPlus filter media will be capable of treating the raw water presently produced by the Town, removing iron and other impurities to comply with all State of Delaware Drinking Water Quality Regulations. Thus, the use of domestic filter media would require replacement of the underdrain and associated piping which would increase the cost of the project. In addition, the evaluation of the supporting documentation also demonstrated that the foreign filter media will be able to meet the proposed project design and specifications with no additional cost to the Town.</P>
        <P>The Town has provided information to the EPA demonstrating that there are no filter media manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonable quantity and of a satisfactory quality to meet the required technical specifications. Eight domestic manufacturers of filter media were considered for this project but did not meet the specifications for the project.</P>

        <P>The April 28, 2009 EPA HQ Memorandum, Implementation of Buy American provisions of Public Law 111-5, the “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009”, defines<PRTPAGE P="144"/>reasonably available quantity as “the quantity of iron, steel, or relevant manufactured good is available or will be available at the time needed and place needed, and in the proper form or specification as specified in the project plans and design.” The Town has incorporated specific technical design requirements for installation of filter media at their three Well Houses.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the ARRA is to stimulate economic recovery in part by funding current infrastructure construction, not to delay projects that are “shovel ready” by requiring utilities, such as the Town, to revise their standards and specifications, institute a new bidding process, and potentially choose a more costly, less efficient project. The imposition of ARRA Buy American requirements on such projects otherwise eligible for State Revolving Fund assistance would result in unreasonable delay and thus displace the “shovel ready” status for this project. To further delay construction is in direct conflict with a fundamental economic purpose of the ARRA, which is to create or retain jobs. The OIA has reviewed this waiver request and to the best of our knowledge at the time of review has determined that the supporting documentation provided by the Town is sufficient to meet the criteria listed under Section 1605(b) and in the April 28, 2009, “Implementation of Buy American provisions of Public Law 111-5, the `American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009' Memorandum:” Iron, steel, and the manufactured goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality. The basis for this project waiver is the authorization provided in Section 1605(b)(2). Due to the lack of production of this product in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality in order to meet the Town's technical specifications, a waiver from the Buy American requirement is justified.</P>
        <P>The March 31, 2009 Delegation of Authority Memorandum provided Regional Administrators with the authority to issue exceptions to Section 1605 of ARRA within the geographic boundaries of their respective regions and with respect to requests by individual grant recipients. Having established both a proper basis to specify the particular good required for this project, and that this manufactured good was not available from a producer in the United States, the Town of Smyrna is hereby granted a waiver from the Buy American requirements of Section 1605(a) of Public Law 111-5 for the purchase of GreensandPlus filter media using ARRA funds as specified in the Town of Smyrna's request of October 1, 2010. This supplementary information constitutes the detailed written justification required by Section 1605(c) for waivers “based on a finding under subsection (b).”</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Burden Statement</HD>
        <P>On October 12, 2010, the FTC sought comment on the information collection requirements associated with the Rule, 16 CFR part 455. 75 FR 62538. No comments were received. Accordingly, the FTC retains its previously published burden estimates.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total annual hours burden:</E>1,974,589 hours.</P>
        <P>The Rule has no recordkeeping requirements. The estimated burden relating solely to disclosure requirements is 1,974,589 hours. As explained in more detail below, this estimate is based on the number of used car dealers (53,735<SU>2</SU>
          <FTREF/>), the number of used cars sold by dealers annually (approximately 24,531,374<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/>), and the time needed to fulfill the information collection tasks required by the Rule.<SU>4</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>4</SU>Some dealers opt to contract with outside contractors to perform the various tasks associated with complying with the Rule. Staff assumes that outside contractors would require about the same amount of time and incur similar cost as dealers to perform these tasks. Accordingly, the hour and cost burden totals shown, while referring to “dealers,” incorporate the time and cost borne by outside companies in performing the tasks associated with the Rule. In addition, the time estimates that follow repeat those that the FTC published in the 2007 PRA clearance renewal-related<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices (72 FR 46487 (Aug. 20, 2007); 72 FR 71911 71912 (Dec. 19, 2007)) without receiving public comment. Absent prospective specific industry estimates to the contrary, staff will continue to apply these estimates, which staff believes are reasonable.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Rule requires that used car dealers display a one-page, double-sided Buyers Guide on each used car that they offer for sale. The component tasks associated with the Rule's required display of Buyers Guides include: (1) Ordering and stocking Buyers Guides; (2) entering data on Buyers Guides; (3) displaying the Buyers Guides on vehicles; (4) revising Buyers Guides as necessary; and (5) complying with the Rule's requirements for sales conducted in Spanish.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">1. Ordering and Stocking Buyers Guides:</E>Dealers should need no more than an average of two hours per year to obtain Buyers Guides, which are readily available from many commercial printers or can be produced by an office word-processing or desk-top publishing system.<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/>Based on a population of 53,735 dealers, the annual hours burden for producing or obtaining and stocking Buyers Guides is 107,470 hours.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>5</SU>Buyers Guides are also available online from the FTC's Web site,<E T="03">http://www.ftc.gov,</E>as links to<E T="03">A Dealer's Guide to the Used Car Rule</E>at<E T="03">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/autos/bus13.shtm.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>
          <E T="03">2. Entering Data on Buyers Guides:</E>The amount of time required to enter applicable data on Buyers Guides may vary substantially, depending on whether a dealer has automated the process. For used cars sold “as is,” copying vehicle-specific data from dealer inventories to Buyers Guides and checking the “No Warranty” box may take two to three minutes per vehicle if done by hand, and only seconds for those dealers who have automated the process or use pre-printed forms. Staff estimates that this task will require an average of two minutes per Buyers Guide. Similarly, for used cars sold under warranty, the time required to check the “Warranty” box and to add warranty information, such as the<PRTPAGE P="146"/>additional information required in the Percentage of Labor/Parts and the Systems Covered/Duration sections of the Buyers Guide, will depend on whether the dealer uses a manual or automated process or Buyers Guides that are pre-printed with the dealer's standard warranty terms. Staff estimates that these tasks will take an average of one additional minute,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>cumulatively, an average total time of three minutes for each used car sold under warranty.</P>
        <P>Staff estimates that approximately fifty percent of used cars sold by dealers are sold “as is,” with the other half sold under warranty. Therefore, staff estimates that the overall time required to enter data on Buyers Guides consists of 408,856 hours for used cars sold without a warranty (24,531,374 vehicles × 50% × 2 minutes per vehicle) and 613,284 hours for used cars sold under warranty (24,531,374 vehicles × 50% × 3 minutes per vehicle) for a cumulative estimated total of 1,022,140 hours.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">3. Displaying Buyers Guides on Vehicles:</E>Although the time required to display the Buyers Guides on each used car may vary substantially, FTC staff estimates that dealers will spend an average of 1.75 minutes per vehicle to match the correct Buyers Guide to the vehicle and to display it on the vehicle. The estimated burden associated with this task is approximately 715,498 hours for the 24,531,374 vehicles sold in 2009 (24,531,374 vehicles × 1.75 minutes per vehicle).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">4. Revising Buyers Guides as Necessary:</E>If negotiations between the buyer and seller over warranty coverage produce a sale on terms other than those originally entered on the Buyers Guide, the dealer must revise the Buyers Guide to reflect the actual terms of sale. According to the original rulemaking record, bargaining over warranty coverage rarely occurs. Staff notes that consumers often do not need to negotiate over warranty coverage because they can find vehicles that are offered with the desired warranty coverage online or in other ways before ever contacting a dealer. Accordingly, staff assumes that the Buyers Guide will be revised in no more than two percent of sales, with an average time of two minutes per revision. Therefore, staff estimates that dealers annually will spend approximately 16,354 hours revising Buyers Guides (24,531,374 vehicles × 2% × 2 minutes per vehicle).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">5. Spanish Language Sales:</E>The Rule requires that contract disclosures be made in Spanish if a sale is conducted in Spanish.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Rule permits displaying both an English and a Spanish language Buyers Guide to comply with this requirement.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>Many dealers with large numbers of Spanish-speaking customers likely will post both English and Spanish Buyers Guides to avoid potential compliance violations.</P>

        <P>Calculations from United States Census Bureau surveys indicate that approximately 6.5 percent of the United States population speaks Spanish at home, without also speaking fluent English.<SU>8</SU>

          <FTREF/>Staff therefore projects that approximately 6.5 percent of used car sales will be conducted in Spanish. Dealers will incur the additional burden of completing and displaying a second Buyers Guide in 6.5 percent of sales assuming that dealers choose to comply with the Rule by posting both English and Spanish Buyers Guides. The annual hours burden associated with completing and posting Buyers Guides is 1,737,638 hours (1,022,140 hours for entering data on Buyers Guides plus 715,498 hours for displaying Buyers Guides). Therefore, staff estimates that the additional burden caused by the Rule's requirement that dealers display Spanish language Buyers Guides when conducting sales in Spanish is 112,947 hours (1,737,638 hours × 6.5%). The other components of the annual hours burden,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>purchasing Buyers Guides and revising them for changes in warranty coverage, remain unchanged.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">1. Labor costs:</E>Labor costs are derived by applying appropriate hourly cost figures to the burden hours described above. Staff has determined that all of the tasks associated with ordering forms, entering data on Buyers Guides, posting Buyers Guides on vehicles, and revising them as needed, including the corresponding tasks associated with Spanish Buyers Guides, are typically done by clerical or low-level administrative personnel. Using a clerical cost rate of $13.32 per hour<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>and an estimated burden of 1,974,589 hours for disclosure requirements, the total labor cost burden would be approximately $26,301,525.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>9</SU>The hourly rate is based on Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of the mean hourly wage for office clerks, general. Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2009, available at<E T="03">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes439061.htm#nat.</E>

        <P>
          <E T="03">2. Capital or other non-labor costs:</E>Although the cost of Buyers Guides can vary considerably, based on industry input staff estimates that the average cost of each Buyers Guide is twenty cents. The estimated cost of Buyers Guides for the 24,531,374 used cars sold by dealers in 2009 is approximately $4,906,275. In making this estimate, staff conservatively assumes that all dealers will purchase preprinted forms instead of producing them internally, although dealers may produce them at minimal expense using current office automation technology. Capital and start-up costs associated with the Rule are minimal.</P>

        <P>Healthcare System Surge Capacity at the Community Level—New—National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, (NCEZID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Background and Brief Description</HD>
        <P>The Healthcare Preparedness Activity, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works with other Federal agencies, State governments, medical societies and other public and private organizations to promote collaboration amongst healthcare partners, and to integrate healthcare preparedness into Federal, State and local public health preparedness planning. The goal of the Activity is to help local communities' healthcare delivery and public health sectors effectively and efficiently prepare for and respond to urgent and emergent threats.</P>
        <P>Surge is defined as a marked increase in demand for resources such as personnel, space and material. Health care providers manage both routine surge (predictable fluctuations in demand associated with the weekly calendar, for example) as well as unusual surge (larger fluctuations in demand caused by rarer events such as pandemic influenza). Except in extraordinary cases, providers are expected to manage surge while adhering to their existing standards for quality and patient safety. Currently, health care organizations are expected to prepare for and respond to surges in demand ranging from a severe catastrophe (for example, a nuclear detonation) to more common, less severe events (for example, a worse-than-usual influenza season). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Federal agencies have dedicated considerable funding and technical assistance towards developing and coordinating community-level responses to surges in demand, but it remains a difficult task.</P>
        <P>While there is extensive research on managing collaborations during times of extraordinary pressure where response to surge takes precedence over other activities, less is known about developing and maintaining integrated collaborations during periods where the system must respond to unusual surge but also continue the routine provision of health care. In particular, studies have not explored how these collaborations can build on sustainable relationships between a broad range of stakeholders (including primary care providers) in communities with different market structures and different degrees of investment in public health.</P>
        <P>This study aims to generate information about the role of community-based collaborations in disaster preparedness that the CDC can use to develop its programs guiding and supporting these collaborations. This project will explore barriers and facilitators to coordination on surge response in ten communities, eight of which have been studied longitudinally since the mid-1990s as part of the Center for Studying Health System Change's (HSC's) Community Tracking Study (CTS). Interviews of local healthcare stakeholders will be conducted at 10 sites.</P>
        <P>Interviews will be conducted at a total of 63 organizations over the two years of this project. Within each of the ten communities studied, two emergency practitioner respondents (one from a safety-net hospital and one from a non-safety-net hospital), two primary care providers (one from a large practice and one from a small practice) and two local preparedness experts (one from the County or local public health agency, and one coordinator or collaboration leader) will be interviewed. In three sites (Phoenix, Greenville and Seattle) an additional respondent will be identified from an outlying rural area to offer the perspective of providers in those communities. There is no cost to respondents except their time.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Disproportionate Share Hospital Allotments for Federal FY 2003</HD>
        <P>Under section 1923(f)(3) of the Social Security Act (the Act), States' Federal fiscal year (FY) 2003 disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments were calculated by increasing the amounts of the FY 2002 allotments for each State (as specified in the chart, entitled “DSH Allotment (in millions of dollars)”, contained in section 1923(f)(2) of the Act) by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the prior fiscal year. The allotment, determined in this way, is subject to the limitation that an increase to a State's DSH allotment for a FY cannot result in the DSH allotment exceeding the greater of the State's DSH allotment for the previous FY or 12 percent of the State's total medical assistance expenditures for the allotment year (this is referred to as the 12 percent limit).</P>
        <P>Most States'<E T="03">actual</E>FY 2002 allotments were determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1923(f)(4) of the Act which allowed for a special DSH calculation rule for FY 2001 and FY 2002. However, as indicated previously, the calculation of States' FY 2003 allotments was<E T="03">not</E>based on the actual FY 2002 DSH allotments; rather, section 1923(f)(3) of the Act requires that the States' FY 2003 allotments be determined using the amount of the States' FY 2002 allotments specified in the chart in section 1923(f)(2) of the Act. The exception to this is the calculation of the FY 2003 DSH allotments for certain “Low-DSH States” (defined in section 1923(f)(5) of the Act). Under the Low-DSH State provision, there is a special calculation methodology for the Low-DSH States only. Under this methodology, the FY 2003 allotments were determined by increasing States' actual FY 2002 DSH allotments, rather than their FY 2002 allotments specified in the chart in section 1923(f)(2) of the Act, by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the previous fiscal year.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. DSH Allotments for FY 2004</HD>
        <P>Section 1001(a) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173, enacted on December 8, 2003) amended section 1923(f)(3) of the Act to provide for a “Special, Temporary Increase In Allotments On A One-Time, Non-Cumulative Basis.” Under this provision, States' FY 2004 DSH allotments were determined by increasing their FY 2003 allotments by 16 percent, and the FY DSH allotment amounts so determined were not subject to the 12 percent limit.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. DSH Allotments for Non-Low DSH States for FY 2005, and FYs Thereafter</HD>
        <P>Under the methodology contained in section 1923(f)(3)(C) of the Act, as amended by section 1001(a)(2) of the MMA, the non-Low-DSH States' DSH allotments for FY 2005 and subsequent FYs continue at the same level as the States' DSH allotments for FY 2004 until a “fiscal year specified” occurs. The fiscal year specified is the first FY for which the Secretary estimates that a State's DSH allotment equals (or no longer exceeds) the DSH allotment as would have been determined under the statute in effect before the enactment of the MMA. We determine whether the fiscal year specified has occurred under a special parallel process. Specifically, under this parallel process, a “parallel” DSH allotment is determined for FYs after 2003 by increasing the State's DSH allotment for the previous FY by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the prior FY, subject to the 12 percent limit. This is the methodology as would otherwise have been applied under section 1923(f)(3)(A) of the Act, notwithstanding the application of the provisions of MMA. The fiscal year specified, is the FY in which the parallel DSH allotment calculated under this special parallel process equals or exceeds the FY 2004 DSH allotment, as determined under the MMA provisions. Once the fiscal year specified occurs for a State, that State's FY DSH allotment will be calculated by increasing the State's previous actual FY DSH allotment (which would be equal to the FY 2004 DSH allotment) by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the previous FY, subject to the 12 percent limit. The following example illustrates how the FY DSH allotment would be calculated for FYs after FY 2004.</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Example</E>—In this example, we are determining the parallel FY 2009 DSH allotment. A State's actual FY 2003 DSH allotment is $100 million. Under the MMA, this State's actual FY 2004 DSH allotment would be $116 million ($100 million increased by 16 percent). The State's DSH allotment for FY 2005 and subsequent FYs would continue at the $116 million FY 2004 DSH allotment for FYs following FY 2004 until the fiscal year specified occurs. Under the separate parallel process, we determine<PRTPAGE P="149"/>whether the fiscal year specified has occurred by calculating the State's DSH allotments in accordance with the statute in effect before the enactment of the MMA. Under this special process, we continue to determine the State's parallel DSH allotment for each FY by increasing the State's parallel DSH allotment for the previous FY (as also determined under the special parallel process) by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the previous FY, and subject to the 12 percent limit. Assume for purposes of this example that, in accordance with this special parallel process, the State's parallel FY 2008 DSH allotment was determined to be $115 million and the percentage change in the CPI-U for FY 2008 (the previous FY) relevant for the calculation of the FY 2009 DSH allotment was 4.4 percent. That is, the percentage change for the CPI-U for FY 2008, the year before FY 2009, was 4.4 percent. Therefore, the State's special parallel process FY 2009 DSH allotment amount would be calculated by increasing the special parallel process FY 2008 DSH allotment amount of $115 million by 4.4 percent; this results in a parallel process DSH allotment process amount for FY 2009 of $120.06 million. Since $120.06 million is greater than $116 million (the actual FY 2004 DSH allotment calculated under the MMA), we would determine that FY 2009 is the fiscal year specified (the first year that the FY 2004 allotment equals or no longer exceeds the parallel process allotment). Since FY 2009 is the fiscal year specified, we would then determine the State's FY 2009 allotment by increasing the State's<E T="03">actual</E>FY 2008 DSH allotment ($116 million) by the percentage change in the CPI-U for FY 2008 (4.4 percent). Therefore, the State's FY 2009 DSH allotment would be $121.104 million ($116 million increased by 4.4 percent); for purposes of the calculation in this example, the application of the 12 percent limit has no effect. Furthermore, for FY 2009 and thereafter, the State's DSH allotment would be calculated under the provisions of section 1923(f)(3)(A) of the Act by increasing the State's previous FY's DSH allotment by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the previous FY, subject to the 12 percent limit.</P>
          <P>However, as amended by section 1001(b)(4) of the MMA, section 1923(f)(5)(B) of the Act also contains criteria for determining whether a State is a Low-DSH State, beginning with FY 2004. This provision is described in section I.D.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. DSH Allotments for Low-DSH States for FY 2004 and FYs Thereafter</HD>
        <P>Section 1001(b)(1) of the MMA amended section 1923(f)(5) of the Act regarding the calculation of the FY DSH allotments for “Low-DSH” States for FY 2004 and subsequent fiscal years. Specifically, under section 1923(f)(5)(B) of the Act, as amended by section 1001(b)(4) of the MMA, a State is considered a Low-DSH State for FY 2004 if its total DSH payments under its State plan for FY 2000 (including Federal and State shares) as reported to CMS as of August 31, 2003, are greater than 0 percent and less than 3 percent of the State's total FY 2000 expenditures under its State plan for medical assistance. For States that meet the Low-DSH criteria, their FY 2004 DSH allotments are calculated by increasing their FY 2003 DSH allotments by 16 percent. Therefore, for FY 2004, Low-DSH States' FY DSH allotments are calculated in the same way as the DSH allotments for regular States, which under section 1923(f)(3) of the Act, get the special temporary increase for FY 2004.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, for States meeting the MMA's Low-DSH definition, the DSH allotments for FYs 2005 through 2008 will continue to be determined by increasing the previous FY's DSH allotment by 16 percent. The Low-DSH States' DSH allotments for FYs 2004 through 2008 are not subject to the 12 percent limit. The Low-DSH States' DSH allotments for FYs 2009 and subsequent FYs are calculated by increasing those States' DSH allotments for the prior FY by the percentage change in the CPI-U for that prior fiscal year. For FYs 2009 and thereafter, the DSH allotments so determined would be subject to the 12 percent limit.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Institutions for Mental Diseases DSH Limits for FYs 1998 and Thereafter</HD>
        <P>Under section 1923(h) of the Act, Federal financial participation (FFP) is not available for DSH payments to institutions for mental diseases (IMDs) and other mental health facilities that are in excess of State-specific aggregate limits. Under this provision, this aggregate limit for DSH payments to IMDs and other mental health facilities is the lesser of a State's FY 1995 total computable (State and Federal share) IMD and other mental health facility DSH expenditures applicable to the State's FY 1995 DSH allotment (as reported on the Form CMS-64 as of January 1, 1997), or the amount equal to the product of the State's current year total computable DSH allotment and the applicable percentage.</P>
        <P>Each State's IMD limit on DSH payments to IMDs and other mental health facilities was calculated by first determining the State's total computable DSH expenditures attributable to the FY 1995 DSH allotment for mental health facilities and inpatient hospitals. This calculation was based on the total computable DSH expenditures reported by the State on the Form CMS-64 as mental health DSH and inpatient hospital DSH as of January 1, 1997. We then calculate an “applicable percentage.” The applicable percentage for FY 1998 through FY 2000 (1995 IMD DSH percentage) is calculated by dividing the total computable amount of IMD and mental health DSH expenditures applicable to the State's FY 1995 DSH allotment by the total computable amount of all DSH expenditures (mental health facility plus inpatient hospital) applicable to the FY 1995 DSH allotment. For FY 2001 and thereafter, the applicable percentage is defined as the lesser of the applicable percentage as calculated above (for FYs 1998 through 2001) or 50 percent for FY 2001; 40 percent for FY 2002; and 33 percent for each subsequent fiscal year.</P>
        <P>The applicable percentage is then applied to each State's total computable FY DSH allotment for the current fiscal year. The State's total computable FY DSH allotment is calculated by dividing the State's Federal share DSH allotment for the FY by the State's Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for that fiscal year.</P>
        <P>In the final step of the calculation of the IMD DSH Limit, the State's total computable IMD DSH limit for the FY is set at the lesser of the product of a State's current FY total computable DSH allotment and the applicable percentage for that FY, or the State's FY 1995 total computable IMD and other mental health facility DSH expenditures applicable to the State's FY 1995 DSH allotment as reported on the Form CMS-64.</P>
        <P>The MMA legislation did not amend the Medicaid statute with respect to the calculation of the IMD DSH limit.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Publication in the<E T="7462">Federal Register</E>of Preliminary and Final Notice for DSH Allotments and IMD DSH Limits</HD>
        <P>In general, we initially determine States' DSH allotments and IMD DSH limits for a FY using estimates of medical assistance expenditures, including DSH expenditures in their Medicaid programs. These estimates are provided by States each year on the August quarterly Medicaid budget reports (Form CMS-37) before the FY for which the DSH allotments and IMD DSH limits are being determined. Also, as part of the basic determination of preliminary DSH allotments for a FY, we use the available CPI-U percentage increase that is available before the beginning of the FY for which the allotment is being determined to determine the preliminary FY DSH allotment. For example, in determining the preliminary FY 2011 DSH allotment, we would apply the CPI-U percentage increase for FY 2010 that was available just before the beginning of FY 2011 on October 1, 2010.</P>

        <P>The DSH allotments and IMD DSH limits determined using these estimates and CPI-U percentage increases<PRTPAGE P="150"/>available before the beginning of the FY are referred to as “<E T="03">preliminary.</E>” Only after we receive States' reports of the actual related medical assistance expenditures through the quarterly expenditure report (Form CMS-64), and the final historic CPI-U percentage increases for the prior FY, which occurs after the end of the FY, are the “<E T="03">final</E>” DSH Allotments and IMD DSH limits determined.</P>
        <P>The notice published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on December 19, 2008 (73 FR 77704), included the announcement of the preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments (based on estimates), and the preliminary FY 2009 IMD DSH limits (since they were based on the preliminary DSH allotments for FY 2009). A correction notice published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on January 26, 2009 (74 FR 4439) provided a correction to the chart of preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments published in the December 19, 2008<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Finally, the notice published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010 (75 FR 21314), included the announcement of the revised preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments to reflect increases in the amount of the States' DSH allotments for FY 2009 and FY 2010 pursuant to the enactment on February 17, 2009 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (section 5002 of Pub. L. 111-5) and revisions to the CPI-U percentage increase for FY 2008, and the revised preliminary FY 2009 IMD DSH limits (since they were based on the revised preliminary DSH allotments for FY 2009).</P>
        <P>This notice announces the<E T="03">final</E>FY 2009 DSH allotments and the<E T="03">final</E>FY 2009 IMD DSH limits (since these are now based on the actual expenditures for that fiscal year), the<E T="03">preliminary</E>FY 2011 DSH allotments (based on expenditure estimates), and the<E T="03">preliminary</E>IMD DSH limits for FY 2011 (since they are based on the preliminary DSH allotments for FY 2011).

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. DSH Allotments for the State of Tennessee</HD>

        <P>Section 1923(f)(6)(A) of the Act, as amended by section 404 of Public Law 109-432 (enacted on December 20, 2006), section 204 of Public Law 110-173 (enacted on December 29, 2007), section 202 of Public Law 110-275 (enacted on July 15, 2008), section 616 of Public Law 111-3 (enacted on February 4, 2009), and most recently as amended by Section 1054 of Public Law 111-152 (enacted on March 30, 2010) provides for the determination of a DSH allotment for the State of Tennessee for each of FYs 2007 through FY 2011, for 2 periods encompassing FY 2012, and for FY 2013. In accordance with this provision, Tennessee's DSH allotment for each of FYs 2007 through 2011 is the greater of $280 million and the FY 2007 Federal medical assistance percentage of the DSH payment adjustments reflected in the State's TennCare Demonstration Project for the demonstration year ending in 2006. In accordance with this provision, the State's Federal share DSH allotment for each of FYs 2007 through 2011 is $305,451,928. Furthermore, Tennessee's DSH allotment for the period October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 (the first quarter of FY 2012) is one-fourth of this amount; that is, $76,362,982. Section 1923(f)(6)(A)(ii) of the Act further limits the amount of Federal funds that are available for DSH payments that Tennessee may make in each of the FYs 2007 through 2011, and for the first quarter of FY 2012 to 30 percent of the DSH allotment. In this regard, the limit on the DSH payments that the State of Tennessee may make is effectively $91,635,578 (30 percent of $305,451,928) for each FY 2007 through FY 2011, and $22,908,895 (30 percent of $76,362,982) for the period October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 (the first quarter of FY 2012. The statute also provides for additional allotments for Tennessee for the period January 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 (quarters 2 through 4 of FY 2012) and for all of FY 2013; future<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices will describe the determination of the amounts of DSH allotments for Tennessee for FY 2012 and FY 2013.</P>

        <P>Section 5002 of the Recovery Act added a new section 1923(f)(3)(E) of the Act; this new section provides for a temporary increase in States' DSH allotments only for FY 2009 and FY 2010.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Revised Preliminary DSH Allotments for FY 2009</HD>

        <P>States' preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments were previously published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on January 26, 2009. However, section 5002 of the Recovery Act enacted after the publication of the preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments provided for an increase in States' DSH allotments from what were previously determined and published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on January 26, 2009. The Recovery Act provided fiscal relief to States during the recent national economic downturn. In that regard, section 1923(f)(3)(E)(i)(I) of the Act, as created by section 5002 of the Recovery Act, requires that, in general, States' DSH allotments for FY 2009 be equal to 102.5 percent of the FY 2009 allotments that would otherwise have been determined; this provision does not apply to certain States as discussed in section G. above.</P>
        <P>As described in section F. above, we typically publish States' preliminary DSH allotments based on expenditure estimates and CPI-U percentage increases available before the FY for which the preliminary DSH allotment is being determined. The preliminary DSH allotments are subsequently finalized after the FY is over and when the applicable inputs for determining the DSH allotments (that is, the applicable expenditures and the CPI-U percentage increase for the previous FY) are final.</P>

        <P>Due to the Recovery Act temporary increase for FY 2009, in this notice we revised the<E T="03">preliminary</E>FY 2009 DSH allotments previously published to reflect updated States' expenditures, and more significantly, to reflect an updated and increased CPI-U percentage increase. As described above, States' DSH allotments are determined by increasing the previous FY allotment by the applicable CPI-U<PRTPAGE P="151"/>percentage increase. In particular, when we previously calculated the preliminary FY 2009 allotments, the applicable CPI-U percentage increase for FY 20<E T="03">08</E>(used for determining the FY 20<E T="03">09</E>DSH allotment), which was available before the beginning of FY 2009, was<E T="03">4.0</E>percent. However, subsequent to our initial determination of the preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments, the historical applicable CPI-U percentage increase for FY 2008 became available; that actual CPI-U increase for FY 2008 is<E T="03">4.4</E>percent. In order to ensure that the full increase in DSH allotments for FY 2009 is available to States during FY 2009, we revised the preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments prior to the end of FY 2009 to reflect both the updated increase in the applicable CPI-U percentage increase for FY 2008 and the 2.5 percent increase in States' FY 2009 DSH allotments as required under the Recovery Act.</P>
        <P>The final FY 2009 allotments contained in this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice reflect the final CPI-U percentage increase for FY 2008 and the actual expenditures in Medicaid for FY 2009.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Preliminary DSH Allotments for FY 2011</HD>
        <P>Sections 1923(f)(3)(E) of the Act, as amended by Section 5002 of the Recovery Act, in general (with the exceptions for certain States described above) provided for a 2.5 percent increase in States' FY 2009 DSH allotments and for States' FY 2010 DSH allotments to be determined as the higher of:</P>
        <P>• 102.5 percent of the DSH allotment for FY 2009, as determined under the Recovery Act provision, or</P>
        <P>• The FY 2010 DSH allotment as would otherwise be calculated without the application of the Recovery Act provision.</P>
        <P>The final FY 2009 DSH allotments contained in this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice and the preliminary FY 2010 DSH allotment for States (as published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010, 75 FR 21314) were determined in accordance with the law, as amended by the Recovery Act.</P>
        <P>As indicated, the Recovery Act DSH allotment provisions apply only for FY 2009 and FY 2010; that is, States' DSH allotments for FY 2011 are determined as DSH allotments were determined prior to the enactment of the Recovery Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Effect of the Recovery Act DSH Provision on Calculation of the States' IMD DSH Limits for FY 2009 and FY 2010, and Determination of Such Limits for FY 2011</HD>

        <P>Section E above described the determination of States' IMD DSH limits for FYs beginning FY 1998 and after, as determined under section 1923(h) of the Act. Section 5002 of the Recovery Act did not amend section 1923(h) of the Act. Accordingly, States' preliminary IMD DSH limits for FY 2009 and FY 2010, the FYs for which the Recovery Act provisions are applicable, were determined as under the existing provisions. As described in section E above, States' DSH allotments are an element of the determination of the IMD DSH limit. Therefore, the DSH allotments for FY 2009 and FY 2010, as determined under the Recovery Act provisions, were used in calculating States' Final FY 2009 (as contained in this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice) and States' preliminary FY 2010 (as previously published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010, 75 FR 21314) IMD DSH limits. This is the same application of States' DSH allotments for purposes of determining States' IMD DSH limits as was applied under section 1923(h) of the Act, regardless of the Recovery Act provision.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Final FY 2009 Federal Share State DSH Allotments</HD>

        <P>Chart 1 of the Addendum to this notice provides the States' final FY 2009 DSH allotments as discussed above in section I.H.1 of this notice. As discussed in that section of this notice, the revised preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments were previously published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010. As described above and in previous<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notices in determining non-Low DSH States' DSH allotments for FYs after FY 2004 under section 1923(f)(3)(C) of the Act for DSH allotments, we determined States' DSH allotments under a “parallel” process. Under the parallel process, for each FY for each State, we have been determining whether the fiscal year specified (as defined in section 1923(f)(3)(D) of the Act) has occurred. Under section 1923(f)(3)(D) of the Act, the fiscal year specified is determined separately for each State and “is the first FY for which the Secretary estimates that the DSH allotment for that State will equal (or no longer exceed) the DSH allotment for that State under the law as in effect before the date of enactment” of MMA. The process in effect before the enactment in MMA is the process described in section 1923(f)(3)(A) of the Act; under this process each States' DSH allotment since FY 2003 is increased by the CPI-U increase for the prior FY and the result is then compared to the State's FY 2004 DSH allotment, as determined under section 1923(f)(3)(C)(i) of the Act (under which the States' FY 2003 DSH allotments were increased by 16 percent). The fiscal year specified for a State is the FY when the FY 2004 allotment is no longer greater than the parallel process DSH allotment.</P>
        <P>We are reiterating the parallel process provision because we determined that FY 2009 was the fiscal year specified for all non-Low DSH States (except Louisiana). Therefore, as indicated in section 1923(f)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, the Final FY 2009 DSH allotment for all non-Low DSH States (except Louisiana) is equal to the prior FY 2008 DSH allotment increased by the CPI-U increase for FY 2008 (4.4 percent). Chart 1 contains the final FY 2009 DSH allotments. For the non-Low DSH States for which the FY 2009 is the fiscal year specified, the FY 2010 and subsequent FY DSH allotments are calculated by increasing the prior FY DSH allotment by the CPI-U increase for the prior fiscal year.</P>
        <P>For Low-DSH States, the FY 2009 DSH allotment is calculated using the same methodology as for the non-Low DSH States for which the fiscal year specified has occurred. That is, for FY 2009 and following FYs, the DSH allotment for Low-DSH States is calculated by increasing the prior FY DSH allotment by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the prior fiscal year.</P>

        <P>The preliminary FY 2009 allotments were initially determined using the States' August 2008 expenditure estimates submitted by the States on the Form CMS-37, and the percentage increase in the CPI-U for the previous FY that was available before the beginning of FY 2009. As discussed in section I.H.1 above, based on the updated CPI-U percentage increase for FY 2008 (from 4.0 percent to 4.4 percent), and the enactment of section 5002 of the Recovery Act (which provides that States' FY 2009 DSH allotments are equal to 102.5 percent of these allotments as would otherwise be determined for the FY), we revised the preliminary FY 2009 DSH allotments, which were published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010. States' final FY 2009 DSH allotments as contained in<PRTPAGE P="152"/>this<E T="04">Federal Register</E>were determined based on States' four quarterly Medicaid expenditure reports (Form CMS-64) for FY 2009 received following the end of FY 2009 and the final applicable percentage increase to CPI-U for the previous FY 2008.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Calculation of the Preliminary FY 2011 Federal Share State DSH Allotments</HD>

        <P>Chart 2 of the Addendum to this notice provides the preliminary FY 2011 DSH allotments determined in accordance with the section 1923(f)(3) of the Act, as described in section I.H.2. As described in that section of this notice, the Recovery Act provisions which increased States' DSH allotments for FY 2009 and FY 2010 are not applicable for determining States' FY 2011 DSH allotments. States' final FY 2011 DSH allotments will be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>following receipt of the States' four quarterly Medicaid expenditure reports (Form CMS-64) for FY 2010 following the end of FY 2011.</P>

        <P>As discussed in section I.E. and I.H.3 above of this notice, section 1923(h) of the Act specifies the methodology to be used to establish the limits on the amount of DSH payments that a State can make to IMDs and other mental health facilities. FFP is not available for IMD or DSH payments that exceed the IMD limits. In this notice, we are publishing the final FY 2009 IMD DSH Limit and the preliminary FY 2011 IMD DSH Limit determined in accordance with the provisions discussed above, and for FY 2009, reflecting the DSH allotments for the FY determined under the provisions of section 1923(f)(3)(E) of the Act, as amended by section 5002 of the Recovery Act.</P>
        <P>Charts 3 and 4 of the Addendum to this notice detail each State's final IMD DSH Limit for FY 2009 and the preliminary IMD DSH Limit for FY 2011, respectively, determined in accordance with section 1923(h) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Collection of Information Requirements</HD>
        <P>This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 35).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement</HD>
        <P>We have examined the impact of this rule as required by Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 1993), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999) and the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)).</P>
        <P>Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). This notice does reach the $100 million economic threshold and thus is considered a major rule under the Congressional Review Act.</P>
        <P>There are no changes between the revised preliminary and final FY 2009 DSH allotments and FY 2009 IMD DSH limits.</P>

        <P>The preliminary FY 2011 DSH allotments being published in this notice are about $365 million less than the preliminary FY 2010 DSH allotments published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010 (75 FR 21314). These decreases are a direct result of the application of the provisions of section 1923(f)(3) of the Act in the calculation of States' DSH allotments, and in particular the provisions of section 1923(f)(3)(E) of the Act as amended by the Recovery Act (which provided for a temporary increase in States' DSH allotments for FY 2009 and FY 2010 during the specified recession period) do not apply with respect to the FY 2011 and following FY DSH allotments.</P>

        <P>The preliminary FY 2011 IMD DSH Limits being published in this notice are about $23 million less than the preliminary FY 2010 IMD DSH Limits published in<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010 (75 FR 21314). This is because the DSH allotment for a FY is a factor in the determination of the IMD DSH limit for the FY, and since the preliminary FY 2011 DSH allotments were decreased as compared to the preliminary FY 2010 DSH allotments, the associated FY 2011 IMD DSH limits for some States were also decreased.</P>
        <P>The RFA requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small businesses, if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. Most hospitals and most other providers and suppliers are small entities, either by nonprofit status or by having revenues of $7.0 million to $34.5 million in any one year. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. We are not preparing an analysis for the RFA because the Secretary has determined that this notice will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Specifically, the effects of the various controlling statutes on providers are not impacted by a result of any independent regulatory impact and not this notice. The purpose of the notice is to announce the latest distributions as required by the statute.</P>
        <P>In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Core-Based Statistical Area for Medicaid payment regulations and has fewer than 100 beds. We are not preparing analysis for section 1102(b) of the Act because the Secretary has determined that this notice will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Medicaid statute (including as most recently amended by the Recovery Act) specifies the methodology for determining the amounts of States' DSH allotments and IMD DSH limits; and as described previously, results in increases in States' DSH allotments and IMD DSH limits for the FYs referred to. The statute applicable to these allotments and limits does not apply to the determination of the amounts of DSH payments made to specific DSH hospitals; rather, these allotments and limits represent an overall limit on the total of such DSH payments. In this regard, we do not believe that this notice will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>

        <P>Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending<PRTPAGE P="153"/>in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2010, that threshold is approximately $135 million. This notice will have no consequential effect on State, local, or Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or on the private sector.</P>
        <P>Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes substantial direct requirement costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has Federalism implications. Since this notice does not impose any costs on State or local governments, the requirements of E.O. 13132 are not applicable.</P>

          <P>HRSA will be issuing non-competitive supplemental grant funding to the University of Wisconsin, Laboratory of Hygiene, Madison, Wisconsin, under the Maternal Child and Health Bureau's Blood Lead Proficiency Testing Program. The University of Wisconsin will use these funds to initiate an orderly closeout of HRSA-funded activities which clearly fall within the purview of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's “Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children” initiative at their National Center for Environmental Health. This action will also accord the University of Wisconsin and the Center additional time to solicit recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention with respect to future funding for this activity.</P>

          <P>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) has continuously supported the National Blood Lead and Erythrocyte Protoprophyrin (EP) Proficiency Testing Program through the University of Wisconsin since 1988. Childhood lead poisoning is a well-characterized public health problem in<PRTPAGE P="160"/>the U.S., and is unfortunately over-represented in minority, immigrant, and low socio-economic populations. The proper detection and treatment of lead poisoning relies entirely on the accurate and precise measurement of blood lead concentration. EP is utilized as an adjunct test to indicate the extent and duration of lead exposure, as well as the detection of iron deficiency, another pediatric health issue. Proficiency testing (PT) is a proven method for assuring and improving laboratory test accuracy. This program has cost-effectively provided monthly PT and other lab quality improvement tools to nearly 600 laboratories across the U.S. and beyond. Of note, the primary focus of the program over the last few years has been the integration of new and usually inexperienced participants into the program. An enrollment boom has been fueled by proliferation of the CLIA-waived LeadCare II point of care testing instrument. In the three years since its introduction, LeadCare II enrollment has grown from zero to 300 laboratories, comprising approximately 40 percent of all participants. Continued participation increases, and the fact that those increases are nearly totally comprised of LeadCare II users, represent both a public health success and a challenge for this program. Since its introduction in early 2007, over 300 of these laboratories have enrolled for PT, swelling program participation to 800 laboratories.</P>

        <P>The participation of large numbers of these labs in voluntary proficiency was by design, and represents a public health success by assuring blood lead screening accuracy where there would otherwise be no evaluation. Three factors contribute to this. First, is the HRSA support of this program, which has been increased to accommodate the additional labs.</P>
        <P>This support allows laboratories to participate at no cost, a vital consideration for voluntary participants. The second factor is the effort of the NBLPT Program to integrate the new technology shortly after it became available, and collaboration with the manufacturer to promote participation. The third factor is that some States have initiated PT requirements, deeming this quality check of sufficient importance to mandate successful participation as a requisite for Medicaid reimbursement. This State-level action illustrates the importance of this PT participation, and may be the beginning of a trend that will serve to increase participation even more.</P>
        <P>The University of Wisconsin will use these funds to initiate an orderly closeout of HRSA-funded activities which clearly falls within the purview of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's “Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children” initiative at their National Center for Environmental Health. This extension with funding will also accord the University of Wisconsin and the Center to solicit recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention with respect to future funding for this activity.</P>

        <P>The Mandatory Guidelines were initially developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564 and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. The “Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs”, as amended in the revisions listed above, requires {or set} strict standards that Laboratories and<PRTPAGE P="162"/>Instrumented Initial Testing Facilities (IITF) must meet in order to conduct drug and specimen validity tests on urine specimens for Federal agencies.</P>
        <P>To become certified, an applicant Laboratory/IITF must undergo three rounds of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification, a Laboratory/IITF must participate in a quarterly performance testing program plus undergo periodic, on-site inspections.</P>
        <P>Laboratories and Instrumented Initial Testing Facilities (IITF) in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements described in the HHS Mandatory Guidelines. A Laboratory/IITF must have its letter of certification from HHS/SAMHSA (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Mandatory Guidelines dated November 25, 2008 (73 FR 71858), the following Laboratories and Instrumented Initial Testing Facilities (IITF) meet the minimum standards to conduct drug and specimen validity tests on urine specimens:</P>

          <P>* The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) voted to end its Laboratory Accreditation Program for Substance Abuse (LAPSA) effective May 12, 1998. Laboratories certified through that program were accredited to conduct forensic urine drug testing as required by U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. As of that date, the certification of those accredited Canadian laboratories will continue under DOT authority. The responsibility for conducting quarterly performance testing plus periodic on-site inspections of those LAPSA-accredited laboratories was transferred to the U.S. HHS, with the HHS' NLCP contractor continuing to have an active role in the performance testing and laboratory inspection processes. Other Canadian laboratories wishing to be considered for the NLCP may apply directly to the NLCP contractor just as U.S. laboratories do.</P>

          <P>Upon finding a Canadian laboratory to be qualified, HHS will recommend that DOT certify the laboratory (<E T="04">Federal Register</E>, July 16, 1996) as meeting the minimum standards of the Mandatory Guidelines published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 30, 2010 (75 FR 22809). After receiving DOT certification, the laboratory will be included in the monthly list of HHS-certified laboratories and participate in the NLCP certification maintenance program.</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—On April 12, 1991, the Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) issued countervailing duty and antidumping duty orders on imports of fresh and chilled Atlantic salmon from Norway (56 FR 14920, 14921). Following five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective March 13, 2000, Commerce issued a continuation of the countervailing duty and antidumping duty orders on imports of fresh and chilled Atlantic salmon from Norway (65 FR 13358). Following second five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective February 13, 2006, Commerce issued a continuation of the countervailing duty order and antidumping duty order on imports of fresh and chilled Atlantic salmon from Norway (71 FR 7512). The Commission is now conducting third reviews to determine whether revocation of the orders would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. It will assess the adequacy of interested party responses to this notice of institution to determine whether to conduct full reviews or expedited reviews. The Commission's determinations in any expedited reviews will be based on the facts available, which may include information provided in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definitions.</E>—The following definitions apply to these reviews:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>is the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of the five-year reviews, as defined by Commerce.</P>
        <P>(2) The<E T="03">Subject Country</E>in these reviews is Norway.</P>
        <P>(3) The<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>is the domestically produced product or products which are like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise.</E>In its original determinations, its expedited first five-year review determinations, and its full second five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>as fresh and chilled Atlantic salmon, including salmon smolts.</P>
        <P>(4) The<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>is the U.S. producers as a whole of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product,</E>or those producers whose collective output of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product. In its original determinations, its expedited first five-year review determinations, and its full second five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>as all domestic producers of fresh and chilled Atlantic salmon, including salmon smolts.</P>
        <P>(5) An<E T="03">Importer</E>is any person or firm engaged, either directly or through a parent company or subsidiary, in importing the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>into the United States from a foreign manufacturer or through its selling agent.</P>

        <P>Participation in the reviews and public service list.—Persons, including industrial users of the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative<PRTPAGE P="167"/>consumer organizations, wishing to participate in the reviews as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11(b)(4) of the Commission's rules, no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The Secretary will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the reviews.</P>
        <P>Former Commission employees who are seeking to appear in Commission five-year reviews are advised that they may appear in a review even if they participated personally and substantially in the corresponding underlying original investigation. The Commission's designated agency ethics official has advised that a five-year review is not considered the “same particular matter” as the corresponding underlying original investigation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 207, the post employment statute for Federal employees, and Commission rule 201.15(b) (19 CFR 201.15(b)), 73 FR 24609 (May 5, 2008). This advice was developed in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics. Consequently, former employees are not required to seek Commission approval to appear in a review under Commission rule 19 CFR 201.15, even if the corresponding underlying original investigation was pending when they were Commission employees. For further ethics advice on this matter, contact Carol McCue Verratti, Deputy Agency Ethics Official, at 202-205-3088.</P>

        <P>Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under an administrative protective order (APO) and APO service list.—Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI submitted in these reviews available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the reviews, provided that the application is made no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the reviews. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the APO.</P>
        <P>Certification.—Pursuant to section 207.3 of the Commission's rules, any person submitting information to the Commission in connection with these reviews must certify that the information is accurate and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge. In making the certification, the submitter will be deemed to consent, unless otherwise specified, for the Commission, its employees, and contract personnel to use the information provided in any other reviews or investigations of the same or comparable products which the Commission conducts under Title VII of the Act, or in internal audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Appendix 3.</P>
        <P>Written submissions.—Pursuant to section 207.61 of the Commission's rules, each interested party response to this notice must provide the information specified below. The deadline for filing such responses is February 2, 2011. Pursuant to section 207.62(b) of the Commission's rules, eligible parties (as specified in Commission rule 207.62(b)(1)) may also file comments concerning the adequacy of responses to the notice of institution and whether the Commission should conduct expedited or full reviews. The deadline for filing such comments is March 18, 2011. All written submissions must conform with the provisions of sections 201.8 and 207.3 of the Commission's rules and any submissions that contain BPI must also conform with the requirements of sections 201.6 and 207.7 of the Commission's rules. The Commission's rules do not authorize filing of submissions with the Secretary by facsimile or electronic means, except to the extent permitted by section 201.8 of the Commission's rules, as amended, 67 FR 68036 (November 8, 2002). Also, in accordance with sections 201.16(c) and 207.3 of the Commission's rules, each document filed by a party to the reviews must be served on all other parties to the reviews (as identified by either the public or APO service list as appropriate), and a certificate of service must accompany the document (if you are not a party to the reviews you do not need to serve your response).</P>
        <P>Inability to provide requested information.—Pursuant to section 207.61(c) of the Commission's rules, any interested party that cannot furnish the information requested by this notice in the requested form and manner shall notify the Commission at the earliest possible time, provide a full explanation of why it cannot provide the requested information, and indicate alternative forms in which it can provide equivalent information. If an interested party does not provide this notification (or the Commission finds the explanation provided in the notification inadequate) and fails to provide a complete response to this notice, the Commission may take an adverse inference against the party pursuant to section 776(b) of the Act in making its determinations in the reviews.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>
        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—On February 19, 1991, the Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) issued antidumping duty orders on imports of the following classes or kinds of heavy forged hand tools from China: (1) Axes and adzes, (2) bars and wedges, (3) hammers and sledges, and (4) picks and mattocks (56 FR 6622). Following the first five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective August 10, 2000, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty order on imports of heavy forged hand tools from China (65 FR 48962). Following second five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective February 16, 2006, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty orders on imports of heavy forged hand tools from China (71 FR 8276). The Commission is now conducting third reviews to determine whether revocation of the orders would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. It will assess the adequacy of interested party responses to this notice of institution to determine whether to conduct full reviews or expedited reviews. The Commission's determinations in any expedited reviews will be based on the facts available, which may include information provided in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definitions.</E>—The following definitions apply to these reviews:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>is the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of the five-year reviews, as defined by Commerce.</P>
        <P>(2) The<E T="03">Subject Country</E>in these reviews is China.</P>
        <P>(3) The<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>is the domestically produced product or products which are like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise.</E>In its original determinations, its full first five-year review determinations, and its expedited second five-year review determinations, the Commission found four<E T="03">Domestic Like Products:</E>(1) Axes, adzes, and hewing tools, other than machetes, with or without handles; (2) bar tools, track tools, and wedges; (3) hammers and sledges, with heads weighing two pounds or more, with or without handles; and (4) picks and mattocks, with or without handles.</P>
        <P>(4) The<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>is the U.S. producers as a whole of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product,</E>or those producers whose collective output of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product. In its original determinations, its full first five-year review determinations, and its expedited second five-year review determinations, the Commission found four<E T="03">Domestic Industries:</E>(1) Domestic producers of axes, adzes and hewing tools, other than machetes, with or without handles; (2) domestic producers of bar tools, track tools, and wedges; (3) domestic producers of hammers and sledges, with heads weighing two pounds or more, with or without handles; and (4) domestic producers of picks and mattocks, with or without handles. The Commission excluded from the<E T="03">Domestic Industries</E>companies that do no more than assemble imported heads with handles purchased from a domestic manufacturer. In the original determinations, the Commission also excluded one domestic producer, Madison Mill, from the<E T="03">Domestic Industries</E>under the related parties provision. In the first reviews, the Commission did not find that Madison Mill engaged in sufficient production-related activity to be considered a domestic producer.</P>
        <P>(5) An<E T="03">Importer</E>is any person or firm engaged, either directly or through a parent company or subsidiary, in importing the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>into the United States from a foreign manufacturer or through its selling agent.</P>

        <P>Participation in the reviews and public service list.—Persons, including industrial users of the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative consumer organizations, wishing to participate in the reviews as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11(b)(4) of the Commission's rules, no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The Secretary will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the reviews.</P>
        <P>Former Commission employees who are seeking to appear in Commission five-year reviews are advised that they may appear in a review even if they participated personally and substantially in the corresponding underlying original investigation. The Commission's designated agency ethics official has advised that a five-year review is not considered the “same particular matter” as the corresponding underlying original investigation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 207, the post employment statute for Federal employees, and Commission rule 201.15(b) (19 CFR 201.15(b)), 73 FR 24609 (May 5, 2008). This advice was developed in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics. Consequently, former employees are not required to seek Commission approval to appear in a review under Commission rule 19 CFR 201.15, even if the corresponding underlying original investigation was pending when they were Commission employees. For further ethics advice on this matter, contact Carol McCue Verratti, Deputy Agency Ethics Official, at 202-205-3088.</P>

        <P>Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under an administrative protective order (APO) and APO service list.—Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI submitted in these reviews available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the reviews, provided that the application is made no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the reviews. A<PRTPAGE P="170"/>separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the APO.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Certification.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.3 of the Commission's rules, any person submitting information to the Commission in connection with these reviews must certify that the information is accurate and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge. In making the certification, the submitter will be deemed to consent, unless otherwise specified, for the Commission, its employees, and contract personnel to use the information provided in any other reviews or investigations of the same or comparable products which the Commission conducts under Title VII of the Act, or in internal audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Appendix 3.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Written submissions.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.61 of the Commission's rules, each interested party response to this notice must provide the information specified below. The deadline for filing such responses is February 2, 2011. Pursuant to section 207.62(b) of the Commission's rules, eligible parties (as specified in Commission rule 207.62(b)(1)) may also file comments concerning the adequacy of responses to the notice of institution and whether the Commission should conduct expedited or full reviews. The deadline for filing such comments is March 18, 2011. All written submissions must conform with the provisions of sections 201.8 and 207.3 of the Commission's rules and any submissions that contain BPI must also conform with the requirements of sections 201.6 and 207.7 of the Commission's rules. The Commission's rules do not authorize filing of submissions with the Secretary by facsimile or electronic means, except to the extent permitted by section 201.8 of the Commission's rules, as amended, 67 FR 68036 (November 8, 2002). Also, in accordance with sections 201.16(c) and 207.3 of the Commission's rules, each document filed by a party to the reviews must be served on all other parties to the reviews (as identified by either the public or APO service list as appropriate), and a certificate of service must accompany the document (if you are not a party to the reviews you do not need to serve your response).</P>
        <P>Inability to provide requested information.—Pursuant to section 207.61(c) of the Commission's rules, any interested party that cannot furnish the information requested by this notice in the requested form and manner shall notify the Commission at the earliest possible time, provide a full explanation of why it cannot provide the requested information, and indicate alternative forms in which it can provide equivalent information. If an interested party does not provide this notification (or the Commission finds the explanation provided in the notification inadequate) and fails to provide a complete response to this notice, the Commission may take an adverse inference against the party pursuant to section 776(b) of the Act in making its determinations in the reviews.</P>

        <P/>
        <P SOURCE="NPAR">
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—On November 25, 1994, the Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) issued an antidumping duty order on imports of paper clips from China (59 FR 60606). Following five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective August 15, 2000, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty order on imports of paper clips from China (65 FR 49784). Following second five-year reviews by Commerce and the Commission, effective February 7, 2006, Commerce issued a continuation of the antidumping duty order on imports of<PRTPAGE P="172"/>paper clips from China (71 FR 6269). The Commission is now conducting a third review to determine whether revocation of the order would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. It will assess the adequacy of interested party responses to this notice of institution to determine whether to conduct a full review or an expedited review. The Commission's determination in any expedited review will be based on the facts available, which may include information provided in response to this notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Definitions.</E>—The following definitions apply to this review:</P>
        <P>(1)<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>is the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of the five-year review, as defined by the Department of Commerce.</P>
        <P>(2) The<E T="03">Subject Country</E>in this review is China.</P>
        <P>(3) The<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>is the domestically produced product or products which are like, or in the absence of like, most similar in characteristics and uses with, the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise.</E>In its original determination and its expedited first and second five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>as certain wire paper clips, coextensive with Commerce's scope.</P>
        <P>(4) The<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>is the U.S. producers as a whole of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product,</E>or those producers whose collective output of the<E T="03">Domestic Like Product</E>constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product. In its original determination and its expedited first and second five-year review determinations, the Commission defined the<E T="03">Domestic Industry</E>to consist of all domestic producers of paper clips.</P>
        <P>(5) An<E T="03">Importer</E>is any person or firm engaged, either directly or through a parent company or subsidiary, in importing the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>into the United States from a foreign manufacturer or through its selling agent.</P>

        <P>Participation in the review and public service list.—Persons, including industrial users of the<E T="03">Subject Merchandise</E>and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative consumer organizations, wishing to participate in the review as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11(b)(4) of the Commission's rules, no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>The Secretary will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the review.</P>
        <P>Former Commission employees who are seeking to appear in Commission five-year reviews are advised that they may appear in a review even if they participated personally and substantially in the corresponding underlying original investigation. The Commission's designated agency ethics official has advised that a five-year review is not considered the “same particular matter” as the corresponding underlying original investigation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 207, the post employment statute for Federal employees, and Commission rule 201.15(b) (19 CFR 201.15(b)), 73 FR 24609 (May 5, 2008). This advice was developed in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics. Consequently, former employees are not required to seek Commission approval to appear in a review under Commission rule 19 CFR 201.15, even if the corresponding underlying original investigation was pending when they were Commission employees. For further ethics advice on this matter, contact Carol McCue Verratti, Deputy Agency Ethics Official, at 202-205-3088.</P>

        <P>Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under an administrative protective order (APO) and APO service list.—Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI submitted in this review available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the review, provided that the application is made no later than 21 days after publication of this notice in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the review. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the APO.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Certification.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.3 of the Commission's rules, any person submitting information to the Commission in connection with this review must certify that the information is accurate and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge. In making the certification, the submitter will be deemed to consent, unless otherwise specified, for the Commission, its employees, and contract personnel to use the information provided in any other reviews or investigations of the same or comparable products which the Commission conducts under Title VII of the Act, or in internal audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Appendix 3.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Written submissions.</E>—Pursuant to section 207.61 of the Commission's rules, each interested party response to this notice must provide the information specified below. The deadline for filing such responses is February 2, 2011. Pursuant to section 207.62(b) of the Commission's rules, eligible parties (as specified in Commission rule 207.62(b)(1)) may also file comments concerning the adequacy of responses to the notice of institution and whether the Commission should conduct an expedited or full review. The deadline for filing such comments is March 18, 2011. All written submissions must conform with the provisions of sections 201.8 and 207.3 of the Commission's rules and any submissions that contain BPI must also conform with the requirements of sections 201.6 and 207.7 of the Commission's rules. The Commission's rules do not authorize filing of submissions with the Secretary by facsimile or electronic means, except to the extent permitted by section 201.8 of the Commission's rules, as amended, 67 FR 68036 (November 8, 2002). Also, in accordance with sections 201.16(c) and 207.3 of the Commission's rules, each document filed by a party to the review must be served on all other parties to the review (as identified by either the public or APO service list as appropriate), and a certificate of service must accompany the document (if you are not a party to the review you do not need to serve your response).</P>
        <P>Inability to provide requested information.—Pursuant to section 207.61(c) of the Commission's rules, any interested party that cannot furnish the information requested by this notice in the requested form and manner shall notify the Commission at the earliest possible time, provide a full explanation of why it cannot provide the requested information, and indicate alternative forms in which it can provide equivalent information. If an interested party does not provide this notification (or the Commission finds the explanation provided in the notification inadequate) and fails to provide a complete response to this notice, the Commission may take an adverse inference against the party pursuant to section 776(b) of the Act in making its determination in the review.</P>

        <P>In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (“Act”), 19 U.S.C. 2273, the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 2, 2010, applicable to workers of Hewlett Packard Company, Personal Systems Group—Desktop Organization at four separate locations: Cupertino, California (including off-site teleworkers reporting to this location); Fort Collins, Colorado (TA-W-73,102A); Houston, Texas (TA-W-73,102B); and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania (TA-W-73,102C). The Department's notice of determination was published in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>on April 23, 2010 (75 FR 21362).</P>
        <P>New investigations were initiated in response to petitions filed on October 20, 2010 by a California State workforce official (TA-W-74,753) and November 23, 2010 by a company official (TA-W-74,917) on behalf of workers in 36 States in the Customer Warranty, Emerging Business, Supply Chain, Volume Operations, Worldwide Sales, and Americas Region Organizations within the Personal Systems Group of the Hewlett Packard Company. The workers are engaged in marketing, sales, call center, customer experience, solutions, engineering, supply chain, research, and product development services for personal computing system products.</P>

        <P>The investigations established that workers in the Customer Warranty,<PRTPAGE P="178"/>Emerging Business, Supply Chain, Volume Operations, Worldwide Sales, and Americas Region Organizations within the Personal Systems Group of the Hewlett Packard Company meet the criteria for certification of Section 222(a) of the Trade Act in the same way as workers certified under TA-W-73,102. Moreover, the investigations established that workers were separated more than one year before the petition date of TA-W-74,753 and that the worker separations were attributable to the same shift of services that were the basis of certification number TA-W-73,102.</P>
        <P>Therefore, at the request of the company official, certification number TA-W-73,102 is being amended to include workers in 36 States in the Customer Warranty, Emerging Business, Supply Chain, Volume Operations, Worldwide Sales, and Americas Region Organizations who were totally or partially separated or threatened with total or partial separation on or after December 9, 2008 through March 2, 2012.

Every petition filed by workers must be signed by at least three individuals of the petitioning worker group.

        <P>In accordance with section 1605(c) of the Recovery Act and section 176.80 of Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the National Science Foundation (NSF) hereby provides notice that on October 22, 2010, the NSF Chief Financial Officer, in accordance with a delegation order from the Director of the agency, granted a limited project exemption of section 1605 of the Recovery Act (Buy American provision) with respect to the anti-roll tank control system that will be used in the ARRV. The basis for this exemption is section 1605(b)(2) of the Recovery Act, in that a “passive-controlled” anti-roll tank control system of satisfactory quality is not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities. The cost of the anti-roll tank control system (∼$130,000) represents less than 0.1% of the total $148 million Recovery Act award provided toward construction of the ARRV.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Recovery Act appropriated $400 million to NSF for several projects being funded by the Foundation's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account. The ARRV is one of NSF's MREFC projects. Section 1605(a) of the Recovery Act, the Buy American provision, states that none of the funds appropriated by the Act “may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.”</P>
        <P>The ARRV has been developed under a cooperative agreement awarded to the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) that began in 2007. UAF executed the shipyard contract in December 2009 and the project is proceeding toward construction. The purpose of the Recovery Act is to stimulate economic recovery in part by funding current construction projects like the ARRV that are “shovel ready” without requiring projects to revise their standards and specifications, or to restart the bidding process again.</P>

        <P>Subsections 1605(b) and (c) of the Recovery Act authorize the head of a Federal department or agency to waive the Buy American provision if the head of the agency finds that: (1) Applying the provision would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) the relevant goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) the inclusion of the goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the project by more than 25 percent. If the head of the Federal department or agency waives the Buy American provision, then the head of the department or agency is required to publish a detailed justification in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Finally, section 1605(d) of the Recovery Act states that the Buy American provision must be applied in a manner consistent with the United States' obligations under international agreements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Finding That Relevant Goods Are Not Produced in the United States in Sufficient and Reasonably Available Quality</HD>

        <P>Installation of an anti-roll tank system is included in the construction specifications to improve the ARRV's response to roll motion. Anti-roll tanks are a relatively simple and efficient way to improve the comfort and safety of personnel sailing aboard the ship. They consist of a tank filled with fluid (usually seawater) that is designed to slow the rate of water transfer from one side of the vessel to the other, trapping the larger amount of water on the higher side of the vessel. The water is trapped<PRTPAGE P="185"/>by either a series of baffles (internal vertical plates), air pressure across the top of the tank, or machinery (<E T="03">i.e.</E>a pump). There are generally two types of systems, “passive” and “active” depending on the mechanism used to trap the water. “Active” generally refers to systems that use machinery such as pumps. These can be complex and require higher amounts of electrical power to operate. “Passive” systems generally use baffles and require no power or other control systems. Between the two is “passive-controlled” which uses cross-over vent pipes fitted with valves that control the flow of air across the top of the tank. The air pressure at the top slows the transfer of water at the bottom.</P>
        <P>The ARRV will operate as a global class ship within the U.S. academic research vessel fleet. As such, it is expected to deploy worldwide where it will encounter a wide variety of sea conditions. Over the vessel's service life, the ARRV is likely to be deployed to Arctic and Antarctic waters, the north Pacific and north Atlantic where the average wave lengths and heights can be extreme as well as vary dramatically. Vessels working in these high latitudes are subject to demanding and often dangerous conditions due to low temperatures, high winds, and rough seas.</P>
        <P>The addition of the anti-roll tank was a high priority recommendation from the Final Design Review (FDR) held in October 2008. The review panel recognized the need for the vessel to periodically work well beyond the Arctic waters that the hull was initially optimized for. At that time, the design of the ARRV was fairly well advanced. Besides the addition of hull length to incorporate the tank structure itself, the type of anti-roll tank specified must meet the following technical requirements based on the status of the project:</P>
        <P>• Ability to minimize ship's roll response in a wide variety of sea states (either “Active” or “Passive-controlled”).</P>
        <P>• Minimize impact on construction cost (low complexity, low additional power).</P>
        <P>• Minimize operating cost (low complexity).</P>
        <P>Failure to meet any of these technical requirements would have severe negative consequences for the project with regard to nonperformance and significant added program cost. It would also result in a vessel that could not successfully support open water science equipment deployments over the anticipated operating range which includes the high polar regions (north and south), as well as the Gulf of Alaska, the north Pacific and the north Atlantic. The average wave lengths and heights encountered in these areas are widely different which means the vessel motions produced will be widely different.</P>
        <P>Following FDR, the project conducted a detailed anti-roll tank study to assess alternatives. A passive-controlled anti-roll tank system was determined to be the best option over a simpler passive system because of its ability to be “tuned” to a wide variety of sea conditions. Since the ARRV will operate as a global-ranging vessel with an emphasis on the high latitudes, an anti-roll tank that can respond to the widely varying sea states encountered is essential. Otherwise, vessel motions will not be adequately reduced to permit safe and effective science operations. All global research vessels are fitted with similar anti-roll tanks. In addition, the system has low power requirements and compared to a fully “active” system has a minimal design impact. In short, the passive-controlled system provides the best performance for the least impact on the existing design.</P>
        <P>Reducing the vessel's roll response decreases the number of days per year that the ship would have to halt science operations because of excessive ship's motion. At a certain point, the vessel motions become severe enough that the crew and science party are no longer effective due to seasickness or fatigue. Once this occurs, the ability to complete the science mission goes down dramatically either causing cancellation of science objectives or extension of the mission to fully complete the objectives. The chance of injuring personnel and/or damaging equipment also goes up dramatically. The daily rate for the ARRV is estimated at $45,000 per day in 2014 dollars. Given that the vessel will operate mainly in the high latitudes, losing 10% of the ship's schedule (30 days) annually due to weather would be likely if a technically compliant anti-roll tank were not fitted in the vessel. In as little as two years the lost science time to the agency could easily exceed the entire cost of the anti-roll tank addition (∼$2.2 million).</P>
        <P>For the purposes of this exemption request, the “anti-roll tank system” includes only the manufactured goods that make up the control portion of the system; namely the control panel, control valves, safety valves, air filters, switches, accumulators, sensors, and spare parts. This request does not include the fabrication of the tanks and cross-over piping which are part of the ship structure being fabricated by the shipyard (∼$2.0 million) all of which will be U.S. steel and U.S. manufacture.</P>
        <P>The market research for this exemption was done by the shipyard in the summer of 2010 and verified by the UAF project team in September 2010. As noted in UAF's request for this exemption, the shipyard performed market research by reviewing industry publications and the Internet in order to assess whether there exists a domestic capability to provide an anti-roll tank system that meets the necessary requirements for safe and successful operation in high latitudes and multiple ocean environments. Only three (3) potential suppliers were identified; two (2) were foreign-owned and the third was domestic. The shipyard compared the existing product lines for compliance with the anti-roll tank technical specifications and requirements as identified above. Following a presentation at the shipyard, it was determined that the one domestic supplier did not provide a system with the required passive-controlled capability. They supplied only a passive system which cannot be tuned to various sea conditions. Furthermore, although domestically-owned it was determined that the system from the single domestic supplier was not actually manufactured domestically. The result of the shipyard's independent market research is consistent with a determination made by the project team in early 2009 when conducting the anti-roll tank study.</P>
        <P>The project's conclusion is there are no US manufacturers who produce a suitable anti-roll system that meets all of the ARRV requirements so an exemption to the Buy American requirements is necessary.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a domestic supplier that could provide a requirements-compliant anti-roll tank system, UAF requested that NSF issue a Section 1605 exemption determination with respect to the purchase of a foreign-supplied, requirements-compliant anti-roll tank system, so that the vessel will meet the specific design and technical requirements which, as explained above, are necessary for this vessel to be able to perform its mission safely and successfully. Furthermore, the shipyard's market research as verified by UAF indicated that an anti-roll tank system compliant with the ARRV's technical specifications and requirements is commercially available from foreign vendors within their standard product lines.</P>

        <P>NSF's Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) and other NSF program staff reviewed the UAF exemption request submittal, found that<PRTPAGE P="186"/>it was complete, and determined that sufficient technical information was provided in order for NSF to evaluate the exemption request and to conclude that an exemption is needed and should be granted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Exemption</HD>
        <P>On October 22, 2010, based on the finding that no domestically produced anti-roll tank system met all of the ARRV's technical specifications and requirements and pursuant to section 1605(b), the NSF Chief Financial Officer, in accordance with a delegation order from the Director of the agency, granted a limited project exemption of the Recovery Act's Buy American requirements with respect to the procurement of a passive-controlled anti-roll tank control system.</P>

        <P>In accordance with section 1605(c) of the Recovery Act and section 176.80 of Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the National Science Foundation (NSF) hereby provides notice that on October 22, 2010, the NSF Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in accordance with a delegation order from the Director of the agency, granted a limited project exemption of section 1605 of the Recovery Act (Buy American provision) with respect to the weather fax that will be used in the ARRV. The basis for this exemption is section 1605(b)(2) of the Recovery Act, in that weather faxes of satisfactory quality are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities. The cost of the weather fax is approximately $11,000, which represents less than .01% of the value of the total $148 million Recovery Act award provided toward construction of the ARRV.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Recovery Act appropriated $400 million to NSF for several projects being funded by the Foundation's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account. The ARRV is one of NSF's MREFC projects. Section 1605(a) of the Recovery Act, the Buy American provision, states that none of the funds appropriated by the Act “may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States.”</P>
        <P>The ARRV has been developed under a cooperative agreement awarded to the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) that began in 2007. Shipyard selection is complete and UAF executed the construction contract in December 2009. The purpose of the Recovery Act is to stimulate economic recovery in part by funding current construction projects like the ARRV that are “shovel ready” without requiring projects to revise their standards and specifications, or to restart the bidding process again.</P>

        <P>Subsections 1605(b) and (c) of the Recovery Act authorize the head of a Federal department or agency to waive the Buy American provision if the head of the agency finds that: (1) Applying the provision would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) the relevant goods are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) the inclusion of the goods produced in the United States will increase the cost of the project by more than 25 percent. If the head of the Federal department or agency waives the Buy American provision, then the head of the department or agency is required to publish a detailed justification in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>. Finally, section 1605(d) of the Recovery Act states that the Buy American provision must be applied in a manner consistent with the United States' obligations under international agreements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Finding That Relevant Goods Are Not Produced In the United StatesIn Sufficient and Reasonably Available Quality</HD>
        <P>The requirement for a weather fax was part of the construction specifications for the ARRV. A weather fax provides valuable, near-real time weather information to the ship as an aid for planning science operations and transit voyages. It is a standard piece of electronic bridge equipment throughout the world as it provides the ship operator with an excellent and necessary forecasting tool to assess weather impact on operations. The specification requirements for the weather fax include:</P>
        <P>1. Performance, reliability, maintainability, durability, size, and weight.</P>
        <P>2. Regulatory body approval.</P>
        <P>3. Availability of spare parts.</P>
        <P>4. Operate within the 2 MHz to 25 MHz range.</P>
        <P>5. Built-in receiver.</P>
        <P>6. Built-in thermal printer.</P>
        <P>7. Human Machine Interface that allows the operator easy access for system set-up.</P>
        <P>8. Pre-programmed with 150 channels for the existing facsimile stations world-wide and allow manual programming by the operator.</P>
        <P>9. Internal back-up battery.</P>
        <P>10. Automatic start/stop recording and printing.</P>
        <P>An important feature operationally is being a stand-alone unit with a built in printer and automatic operation. This provides the bridge watch with a hard copy of weather charts and weather satellite images in the pilothouse without having to access a computer or keep track of when a facsimile station is scheduled to transmit. The automatic operation is critical to minimize distractions to the bridge watch who can then retrieve the hard copy for analysis at a time that will not impact navigational duties. Science and routine vessel operational duties are demanding, especially in the high latitudes where the ARRV will operate. Any unnecessary distractions in the pilothouse can jeopardize the safety of the vessel.</P>

        <P>The ARRV will operate as a Global class ship within the U.S. academic research vessel fleet. As such, it is expected to deploy worldwide where it is likely to encounter highly variable weather conditions. Over the vessel's service life, the ARRV is likely to be deployed to Arctic and Antarctic waters, the north Pacific and north Atlantic<PRTPAGE P="187"/>where the weather conditions change rapidly and dramatically. Vessels working in these high latitudes are subject to demanding and often dangerous conditions due to low temperatures, high winds, and rough seas. Failure to meet any of the technical requirements would have severe negative consequences for the project with regard to operational safety.</P>
        <P>The market research for this exemption was done by the shipyard in the summer of 2010 and verified by the UAF project team in July 2010. As noted in UAF's request for this exemption, the shipyard performed market research by reviewing industry publications, the Internet (including the Marine Electronics Journal Web site) and contacting various electronic supply companies in order to assess whether there exists a domestic capability to provide a weather fax that meets the necessary requirements for safe and successful operation world-wide. Eighteen (18) potential vendors were identified with only six (6) manufacturing a weather fax. Of the six, only one (1) was a U.S. manufacturer. The shipyard then compared the existing product lines for compliance with the weather fax technical specifications and requirements as identified above. It was found that the one U.S. manufacturer did not make a unit that was stand-alone. Instead, the system uses a personal computer to provide both the human interface and printing capability of the weather charts. This requires the bridge watch to actively manage and interface with the system, which takes their attention from other navigational and operational duties. This distraction increases the likelihood of collision, grounding, failure to adequately monitor over-the-side science operations, and inadvertently sailing into dangerous weather conditions. Because of this, all modern ocean-going vessels have at least one stand-alone weather fax system.</P>
        <P>The project's conclusion is there are no U.S. manufacturers who produce a suitable weather fax unit that meets all of the ARRV requirements so an exemption to the Buy American requirements is necessary.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a domestic supplier that could provide a requirements-compliant weather fax, UAF requested that NSF issue a Section 1605 exemption determination with respect to the purchase of a foreign-supplied, requirements-compliant weather fax, so that the vessel will meet the specific design and technical requirements which, as explained above, are necessary for this vessel to be able to perform its mission safely and successfully. Furthermore, the shipyard's market research as verified by UAF indicated that a weather fax compliant with the ARRV's technical specifications and requirements is commercially available from foreign vendors within their standard product lines.</P>
        <P>NSF's Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) and other NSF program staff reviewed the UAF exemption request submittal, found that it was complete, and determined that sufficient technical information was provided in order for NSF to evaluate the exemption request and to conclude that an exemption is needed and should be granted.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Programmatic Environmental Assessment and Final Finding of No Significant Impact for Exemptions From the Implementation Deadline for New Security Requirements</SUBJECT>
        <P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received and expects to receive exemption requests from several nuclear power reactor licensees. Each expected exemption request will be from the implementation date requirement of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 73.55. The NRC is authorized to issue exemptions pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5. In accordance with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC has performed a programmatic environmental assessment of these exemption requests. The NRC concluded that the proposed action constitutes administrative (timing) changes that would not impact the environmental resources near any specified nuclear power plant. Based upon the results of this programmatic environmental assessment, the NRC is issuing a finding of no significant impact.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Assessment</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Identification of the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The proposed action may include issuing exemptions to nuclear power plant licensees for up to 40 nuclear power plant sites, all of which have already been granted plant-specific exemptions granting additional time to implement some of the new requirements of 10 CFR 73.55. These sites are:</P>

        <P>Specifically, the licensees for each of these plants may propose an additional alternate date for full compliance beyond the March 31, 2010 date required by 10 CFR 73.55(a)(1), and if approved by the NRC, would be granted a plant-specific exemption. The proposed action, an exemption extending the schedule for completion of actions required by the revised 10 CFR 73.55, would not involve any physical changes to the reactor(s), fuel, plant structures, support structures, land, or water at each nuclear power plant site. If granted, a plant-specific safety evaluation will be included in the letter to the licensee approving the exemption from the regulation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The Need for the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The proposed action is needed to continue to exempt up to 40 nuclear power plant sites from being in full compliance with new requirements contained in 10 CFR 73.55. The original implementation date was March 31, 2010 and previous exemptions were granted to several licensees from meeting that date. Another round of exemptions is needed to provide these licensees with additional time to comply with the rule requirements. While licensees completed much of the work required by the 10 CFR 73.55 rule change at their plants by the March 31, 2010 implementation date, affected licensees require additional time to complete all newly required modifications.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action</HD>
        <P>The NRC regulation, 10 CFR 73.55, requires NRC nuclear power plant licensees to implement various physical protection requirements to prevent radiological sabotage. The NRC has completed its environmental assessment of the proposed action, and has concluded that, should NRC decide to grant a 10 CFR 73.55 compliance date exemption to these plants, extending the implementation deadline would not significantly affect plant safety and would not significantly affect the probability of an accident.</P>

        <P>The proposed action would not increase the radiological hazard beyond what was analyzed in the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact made by the Commission in promulgating its revisions to 10 CFR 73.55 as discussed in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>notice dated March 27, 2009 (74 FR 13926). There would be no change to radioactive effluents and emissions that would increase radiation exposures to plant workers and members of the public. Therefore, no radiological impacts are expected as a result of the proposed action.</P>
        <P>In addition, there will be no construction or major renovation of any buildings or structures, nor any ground disturbing activities associated with an extension of the compliance deadline. Licensees would not increase or decrease their workforce, nor is traffic to or around any of the subject power plants expected to increase, as a result of an extension of the compliance deadline. Therefore, providing licensees with additional time to comply with the revised requirements of 10 CFR 73.55 would not alter land use, air quality, and water use (quality and quantity) conditions or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits at each of the nuclear power plants that may be the subject of an exemption request. Aquatic and terrestrial habitat in the vicinity of each power plant; threatened, endangered, and protected species under the Endangered Species Act; and essential fish habitat covered by the Magnuson-Stevens Act would not be affected. In addition, historic and cultural resources, socioeconomic conditions, and minority and low-income populations in the vicinity of each power plant would also not be affected by this action.</P>
        <P>As previously noted, in promulgating its amendments to 10 CFR part 73, the Commission prepared an environmental assessment of the rule change and published a finding of no significant impact (10 CFR parts 50, 52, 72, and 73, Power Reactor Security Requirements, 74 FR 13926 (March 27, 2009)). Thus, through the proposed action, the Commission would be granting additional time for the licensees to comply with regulatory requirements for which the Commission has already found no significant impact.</P>
        <P>For the foregoing reasons, the NRC concludes that there would be no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the extension of the implementation date of the new requirements of 10 CFR 73.55.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action</HD>

        <P>As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC considered denial of the proposed actions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>the “no-action” alternative). Denial of the exemption requests would result in no change in current environmental conditions at each of the nuclear power plants.</P>
        <P>Denial of the exemption requests would result in the licensees being in non-compliance with 10 CFR 73.55(a)(1) and thus, subject to NRC enforcement action. The end result, however, would still be ultimate licensee compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, but with the added expense to both the NRC and the licensees of any enforcement actions. The NRC concludes that the environmental impacts of the proposed exemption and the “no action” alternative are similar.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternative Use of Resources</HD>
        <P>The proposed action does not involve the use of any different resources than those considered in the final environmental statements for the granting of the operating licenses for these nuclear power plants and for those plants that have had their licenses renewed, in NUREG-1437, “Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants,” published in May 1996, and its supplements published from 1999 to the present.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Finding of No Significant Impact</HD>
        <P>On the basis of the above environmental assessment, which in accordance with 10 CFR 51.32(a)(4), is incorporated into this finding of no significant impact by reference, the NRC concludes that the proposed action constitutes an administrative change (timing) that would not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action.</P>

        <P>Further details with respect to the proposed action will be available as individual licensees request exemptions. Portions of these requests may contain proprietary and safeguards information and, accordingly, will not available to the public. Other parts of these documents may be examined, and/or copied for a fee, at the NRC's Public Document Room (PDR), located at One White Flint North, Public File Area O-1 F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland 20852.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>
        <P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a revision to an existing guide in the agency's “Regulatory Guide” series. This series was developed to describe and make available to the public information such as methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the agency's regulations, techniques that the staff uses in evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data that the staff needs in its review of applications for permits and licenses.</P>
        <P>Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide 3.71, entitled, “Nuclear Criticality Safety Standards for Fuels and Material Facilities,” was issued with a temporary identification as Draft Regulatory Guide, DG-3030. Regulatory Guide 3.71 provides applicants, licensees, and certificate holders with updated guidance concerning criticality safety standards that the NRC has endorsed for use with nuclear fuels and material facilities. As such, Regulatory Guide 3.71 describes methods that the NRC staff considers acceptable for complying with the NRC's regulations in Title 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 70, “Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material,” and 76, “Certification of Gaseous Diffusion Plants” (10 CFR parts 70 and 76).</P>
        <P>The NRC staff has revised Regulatory Guide 3.71 to provide guidance on complying with these portions of the NRC's regulations. This guide describes procedures for preventing nuclear criticality accidents in operations that involve handling, processing, storing, and/or transporting special nuclear material at fuel and material facilities. It also endorses specific nuclear criticality safety standards developed by the American Nuclear Society's Standards Subcommittee 8 (ANS-8), “Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors.” Regulatory Guide 3.71 is not intended for use by nuclear reactor licensees.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Further Information</HD>

        <P>In July 2010, DG-3030 was published with a public comment period of 60 days from the issuance of the guide. The public comment period closed on September 29, 2010. The staff's responses to the public comments received are located in the NRC's Agencywide Documents Access and Management System under Accession Number ML103210349. Electronic copies of Regulatory guide 3.71, Revision 2 are available through the NRC's public Web site under “Regulatory Guides” at<E T="03">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/.</E>
        </P>

        <P>In addition, regulatory guides are available for inspection at the NRC's Public Document Room (PDR) located at Room O-1F 21, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738. The PDR's mailing address is USNRC PDR, Washington, DC 20555-0001.

          <P>As part of the consolidated line item improvement process (CLIIP), the NRC is announcing the availability of the model application (with model no significant hazards consideration determination) and model safety evaluation (SE) for the plant-specific adoption of Technical Specifications Task Force (TSTF) Traveler TSTF-513, Revision 3, “Revise PWR [pressurized water reactor] Operability Requirements and Actions for RCS [reactor coolant system] Leakage Instrumentation.” TSTF-513, Revision 3, is available in the Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) under Accession Number ML102360355. The proposed changes would revise the Standard Technical Specifications (STS) to define a new time limit for restoring inoperable RCS leakage detection instrumentation to operable status and establish alternate methods of monitoring RCS leakage when one or more required monitors are inoperable. Changes to the Technical Specifications (TS) Bases are included, which reflect the proposed changes and more accurately reflect the contents of the facility design bases related to the operability of the RCS leakage detection instrumentation. The CLIIP model SE will facilitate expedited approval of plant-specific adoption of TSTF-513, Revision 3.</P>

        <P>TSTF-513, Revision 3, is applicable to PWR plants. Licensees opting to apply for this TS change are responsible for reviewing TSTF-513, Revision 3, and the NRC staff's model SE, referencing the applicable technical justifications, providing any necessary plant-specific information, and assessing the completeness and accuracy of their license amendment request (LAR). It is acceptable for licensees to use plant-specific system names, TS numbering and titles. The NRC will process each amendment application responding to this notice of availability according to applicable NRC rules and procedures.</P>
        <P>The CLIIP does not prevent licensees from requesting an alternate approach or proposing changes other than those proposed in TSTF-513, Revision 3. However, significant deviations from the approach recommended in this notice or the inclusion of additional changes to the license require additional NRC staff review and would not be reviewed as a part of the CLIIP. This may increase the time and resources needed for the review or result in NRC staff rejection of the LAR. Licensees desiring significant deviations or additional changes should instead submit an LAR that does not claim to adopt TSTF-513, Revision 3.</P>

        <P>Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3642 and 39 CFR 3020.30<E T="03">et seq.,</E>the Postal Service filed a formal request and associated supporting information to add Priority Mail Contract 33 to the competitive product list.<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/>The Postal Service asserts that Priority Mail Contract 33 is a competitive product “not of general applicability” within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. 3632(b)(3).<E T="03">Id.</E>at 1. The Postal Service states that the prices and classification underlying this contract are supported by Governors' Decision No. 09-6 in Docket No. MC2009-25.<E T="03">Id.</E>The Request has been assigned Docket No. MC2011-13.</P>
        <P>The Postal Service contemporaneously filed a contract related to the proposed new product pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3632(b)(3) and 39 CFR 3015.5. The instant contract has been assigned Docket No. CP2011-49.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Request.</E>In support of its Request, the Postal Service filed six attachments as follows:</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU>Request of the United States Postal service to Add Priority Mail Contract 33 to Competitive Product List and Notice of Filing (Under Seal) of Contract and Supporting Data, December 17, 2010 (Request).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>• Attachment A—a redacted copy of Governors' Decision No. 09-6, originally filed in Docket No. MC2009-25, authorizing certain Priority Mail contracts;</P>
        <P>• Attachment B—a redacted copy of the contract;</P>
        <P>• Attachment C—a proposed change in the Mail Classification Schedule competitive product list;</P>
        <P>• Attachment D—a Statement of Supporting Justification as required by 39 CFR 3020.32;</P>
        <P>• Attachment E—a certification of compliance with 39 U.S.C. 3633(a); and</P>
        <P>• Attachment F—an application for non-public treatment of materials to maintain redacted portions of the contract and supporting documents under seal.</P>

        <P>In the Statement of Supporting Justification, Josen Punnoose, Manager, Shipping Support (A), Shipping Services, asserts that the service to be provided under the contract will cover its attributable costs, make a positive contribution to institutional costs, and increase contribution toward the requisite 5.5 percent of the Postal Service's total institutional costs.<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment D. Thus, Mr. Punnoose contends there will be no issue of market dominant products subsidizing competitive products as a result of this contract.<E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Related contract.</E>A redacted version of the specific Priority Mail Contract 33 is included with the Request.<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment B. The contract will become effective on the day after the Commission provides all necessary regulatory approvals.<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment B, at 5. The contract will expire 5 years from the effective date unless, among other things, either party terminates the agreement upon 30 days' written notice to the other party.<E T="03">Id.</E>The Postal Service represents that the contract is consistent with 39 U.S.C. 3633(a).<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment D.</P>

        <P>The Postal Service filed much of the supporting materials, including the specific Priority Mail Contract 33, under seal.<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment F. It maintains that the contract, customer-identifying information, and related financial information, including the accompanying analyses that provide prices, terms, conditions, cost data, and financial projections, should remain under seal.<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment F, at 2-3. It also requests that the Commission order that the duration of such treatment of all customer-identifying information be extended indefinitely, instead of ending after 10 years.<E T="03">Id.</E>, Attachment F, at 7.</P>

            <SU>8</SU>The Commission has issued an order granting certain exemptive relief to the Trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1) (“1940 Act”).<E T="03">See</E>Investment Company Act Release No. 28171 (October 27, 2008) (File No. 812-13458). In compliance with Commentary .05 to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600, which applies to Managed Fund Shares based on an international or global portfolio, the Trust's application for exemptive relief under the 1940 Act states that the Fund will comply with the Federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposits and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities, including that the securities accepted for deposits and the securities used to satisfy redemption requests are sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Commentary .06 to Rule 8.600 provides that, if the investment adviser to the Investment Company issuing Managed Fund Shares is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such investment adviser shall erect a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer with respect to access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to such Investment Company portfolio.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, Commentary .06 further requires that personnel who make decisions on the open-end fund's portfolio composition must be subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material nonpublic information regarding the open-end fund's portfolio. Commentary .06 to Rule 8.600 is similar to Commentary .03(a)(i) and (iii) to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 5.2(j)(3); however, Commentary .06 in connection with the establishment of a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer reflects the applicable open-end fund's portfolio, not an underlying benchmark index, as is the case with index-based funds. The Sub-Adviser is affiliated with multiple broker-dealers and has implemented a “fire wall” with respect to such broker-dealers regarding access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to the Fund's portfolio.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>In addition, Sub-Adviser personnel who make decisions regarding the Fund's portfolio are subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material nonpublic information regarding the Fund's portfolio.

            <SU>9</SU>An investment adviser to an open-end fund is required to be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). As a result, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser are subject to the provisions of Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act relating to codes of ethics. This Rule requires investment advisers to adopt a code of ethics that reflects the fiduciary nature of the relationship to clients as well as compliance with other applicable securities laws. Accordingly, procedures designed to prevent the communication and misuse of non-public information by an investment adviser must be consistent with Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act.</P>

            <SU>10</SU>The Exchange represents that the Adviser and Sub-Adviser, and their related personnel, are subject to Investment Advisers Act Rule 204A-1. This Rule specifically requires the adoption of a code of ethics by an investment adviser to include, at a minimum: (i) Standards of business conduct that reflect the firm's/personnel fiduciary obligations; (ii) provisions requiring supervised persons to comply with applicable Federal securities laws; (iii) provisions that require all access persons to report, and the firm to review, their personal securities transactions and holdings periodically as specifically set forth in Rule 204A-1; (iv) provisions requiring supervised persons to report any violations of the code of ethics promptly to the chief compliance officer (“CCO”) or, provided the CCO also receives reports of all violations, to other persons designated in the code of ethics; and (v) provisions requiring the investment adviser to provide each of the supervised persons with a copy of the code of ethics with an acknowledgement by said supervised persons. In addition, Rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to provide investment advice to clients unless such investment adviser has (i) adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation, by the investment adviser and its supervised persons, of the Advisers Act and the Commission rules adopted thereunder; (ii) implemented, at a minimum, an annual review regarding the adequacy of the policies and procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and the effectiveness of their implementation; and (iii) designated an individual (who is a supervised person) responsible for administering the policies and procedures adopted under subparagraph (i) above.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">WisdomTree Asia Bond Fund</HD>

        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Fund seeks to provide investors with a high level of total return consisting of both income and capital appreciation. The Fund is an actively managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”). The Fund is designed to provide exposure to a broad range of Asian government and corporate bonds through investment in both local currency (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Hong Kong dollar; South Korean won) and U.S. dollar-denominated Fixed Income Securities. For purposes of this proposed rule change, Fixed Income Securities include bonds, notes or other debt obligations, such as government or corporate bonds, denominated in local currencies or U.S. dollars, as well as issues denominated in Asian local currencies that are issued by “supranational issuers,” such as the European Investment Bank, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Finance Corporation, as well as development agencies supported by other national governments. The Fund may also invest in Money Market Securities and derivative instruments, as described below.</P>
        <P>The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through direct and indirect investments in Fixed Income Securities issued by governments and corporations in Asian countries. The Fund intends to focus on the developing/emerging market economies in Asia, primarily China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. While the Fund is permitted to invest in developed market economies, this is not a focus of the Fund. Therefore, although the Fund is permitted to do so, the Fund is unlikely to invest in issuers in Japan, Australia, or New Zealand.</P>

        <P>The Fund is designed to provide broad exposure to Asian government and corporate bonds and will invest in a range of instruments with varying credit risk and duration. The Fund<PRTPAGE P="196"/>intends to invest in both bonds and debt instruments issued by the governments of Asia and their agencies and instrumentalities and as well in bonds and other debt instruments issued by corporations organized in Asian countries. The Fund also may invest in Fixed Income Securities denominated in Asian local currencies that are issued by supranational issuers, as described above. The Fund also may invest in inflation-linked Fixed Income Securities denominated in Asian local currencies.</P>
        <P>The Fund intends to invest at least 70% of its net assets in Fixed Income Securities.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Fund expects to invest up to 20% of its net assets in Asian corporate bonds. The Fund will invest only in corporate bonds that the Adviser or Sub-Adviser deems to be sufficiently liquid. Generally, a corporate bond must have $200 million or more par amount outstanding and significant par value traded to be considered as an eligible investment.<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>Economic and other conditions in Asia may, from time to time, lead to a decrease in the average par amount outstanding of bond issuances. Therefore, although the Fund does not intend to do so, the Fund may invest up to 5% of its net assets in corporate bonds with less than $200 million par amount outstanding if (i) the Adviser or Sub-Adviser deems such security to be sufficiently liquid based on its analysis of the market for such security (based on, for example, broker-dealer quotations or its analysis of the trading history of the security or the trading history of other securities issued by the issuer), (ii) such investment is consistent with the Fund's goal of providing exposure to a broad range of Asian government and corporate bonds, and (iii) such investment is deemed by the Adviser or Sub-Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund.</P>
        <FTNT>

            <SU>11</SU>The category of “Asian debt” includes both U.S. dollar-denominated debt and non-U.S. or “local” currency debt. According to the Emerging Markets Traders Association, the global dollar amount of emerging market debt instruments traded in 2009 was $4.445 trillion, of which Asian emerging market (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>excluding Japan) debt represented $1.609 trillion. Asian sovereign debt issued by major emerging market countries in 2009 included: (1) China, $175 billion; (2) Hong Kong, $590 billion; (3) India, $164 billion; (4) Indonesia, $63 billion; (5) Malaysia, $119 billion; (6) Philippines, $61 billion; (7) Singapore, $166 billion; (8) South Korea, $172 billion; (9) Taiwan, $27 billion; and (10) Thailand, $43 billion. Local market instruments traded among major Asian emerging markets in 2009 included: (1) Hong Kong, $557 billion; (2) India, $148 billion; (3) China, $147 billion; (4) Singapore, $146 billion; and (5) South Korea, $93 billion. (Source: Emerging Markets Traders Association, 2009 Annual Debt Trading Volume Survey, March 8, 2010. Additional information relating to emerging market corporate bonds is available at:<E T="03">http://www.emta.org.</E>) Local currency bond issuance in emerging East Asian markets (comprising China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam) grew by 18.8% through June 2010.

          <P>The Adviser represents that Asian sovereign debt is typically issued in large par size and tends to be very liquid. Local currency-denominated Asian debt issued by supranational entities is also actively traded. Intra-day, executable price quotations on such instruments are available from major broker-dealer firms. Intra-day price information is available through subscription services, such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, which can be accessed by Authorized Participants and other investors.</P>

          <P>

            <SU>12</SU>The Adviser represents that the size and liquidity of the market for emerging market bonds, including Asian corporate bonds, generally has been increasing in recent years. The aggregate dollar amount of emerging market corporate bonds traded in 2009 was $514 billion, representing a 32% increase over the $380 billion traded in 2008. Turnover in emerging market corporate debt accounted for 12% of the overall volume of emerging market debt of $4.445 trillion in 2009, an increase over the 9% share in 2008. (Source: Emerging Markets Traders Association Press Release, March 8, 2010.) Additional information relating to emerging market corporate bonds is available at:<E T="03">http://www.emta.org.</E>Annual growth in the emerging East Asian corporate bond markets (comprising China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam) increased by 24.4% through June 2010. China's local currency corporate bond market grew by 52.7% over that period. (Source: Asian Development Bank,<E T="03">Asia's Local Bond Markets Expand 18.8%, Foreign Investment Soars</E>(October 4, 2010),<E T="03">http://www.adb.org.</E>) Corporate bonds outstanding in representative emerging East Asian markets as of June 2010, included: (1) China, $546 billion; (2) Hong Kong, $73 billion; (3) Indonesia, $10 billion; (4) South Korea, $571 billion; (5) Malaysia, $91 billion; (6) Philippines, $8 billion; (7) Singapore, $70 billion; (8) Thailand, $38 billion; and (9) Viet Nam, $2 billion (Source: Asian Development Bank,<E T="03">Asia Bond Monitor</E>(October 2010),<E T="03">http://www.adb.org.</E>)</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Fund typically will maintain aggregate portfolio duration of between 2 and 8 years. Aggregate portfolio duration is a measure of the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in the level of interest rates. The Fund's actual portfolio duration may be longer or shorter depending upon market conditions.</P>
        <P>The universe of Asian Fixed Income Securities includes securities that are rated “investment grade” as well as “non-investment grade” securities. The Fund is designed to provide a broad-based, representative exposure to Asian government and corporate bonds and therefore will invest in both investment grade and non-investment grade securities in a manner designed to provide this exposure. The Fund expects that it will have 75% or more of its assets invested in investment grade securities, and no more than 25% of its assets invested in non-investment grade securities. Because the Fund is designed to provide exposure to a broad range of Asian government and corporate bonds, and because the debt ratings of the Asian governments and those corporate issuers will change from time to time, the exact percentage of the Fund's investments in investment grade and non-investment grade securities will change from time to time in response to economic events and changes to the credit ratings of the Asian government and corporate issuers.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>Within the non-investment grade category, some issuers and instruments are considered to be of lower credit quality and at higher risk of default. In order to limit its exposure to these more speculative credits, the Fund will not invest more than 15% of its assets in securities rated B or below by Moody's, or equivalently rated by S&amp;P or Fitch. The Fund does not intend to invest in unrated securities. However, it may do so to a limited extent, such as where a rated security becomes unrated, if such security is, determined by the Adviser and Sub-Adviser to be of comparable quality. In determining whether a security is of “comparable quality,” the Adviser and Sub-Adviser will consider, for example, whether the issuer of the security has issued other rated securities.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>13</SU>As of October 19, 2010, government debt of China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand was rated investment grade by S&amp;P and Fitch. The sovereign debt of Indonesia and the Philippines was rated just below investment grade.<E T="03">See http://www.standardandpoors.com; http://www.fitchratings.com.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Fund will hold Fixed Income Securities of at least 13 non-affiliated issuers. The Fund will not concentrate 25% or more of the value of its total assets (taken at market value at the time of each investment) in any one industry, as that term is used in the 1940 Act (except that this restriction does not apply to obligations issued by the U.S. government, or any non-U.S. government, or their respective agencies and instrumentalities or government-sponsored enterprises).</P>

        <P>The Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Fund will invest its assets, and otherwise conduct its operations, in a manner that is intended to satisfy the qualifying income, diversification and distribution requirements necessary to establish and maintain RIC qualification under Subchapter M. The Subchapter M diversification tests generally require that (i) the Fund invest no more than 25% of its total assets in securities (other than securities of the U.S. government or other RICs) of any one issuer or two or more issuers that are<PRTPAGE P="197"/>controlled by the Fund and that are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses, and (ii) at least 50% of the Fund's total assets consist of cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with investments in such other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer.</P>
        <P>In addition to satisfying the above referenced RIC diversification requirements, no portfolio security held by the Fund (other than U.S. government securities and non-U.S. government securities) will represent more than 30% of the weight of the portfolio and the five highest weighted portfolio securities of the Fund (other than U.S. government securities and/or non-U.S. government securities) will not in the aggregate account for more than 65% of the weight of the portfolio. For these purposes, the Fund may treat repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities or non-U.S. government securities as U.S. or non-U.S. government securities, as applicable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Money Market Securities</HD>
        <P>The Fund intends to invest in Money Market Securities in order to help manage cash flows in and out of the Fund, such as in connection with payment of dividends or expenses, and to satisfy margin requirements, to provide collateral or to otherwise back investments in derivative instruments. For these purposes, Money Market Securities include: short-term, high-quality obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or the agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. government; short-term, high-quality securities issued or guaranteed by non-U.S. governments, agencies and instrumentalities; repurchase agreements backed by U.S. government securities; money market mutual funds; and deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks and financial institutions. All Money Market Securities acquired by the Fund will be rated investment grade; except that the Fund may invest in unrated Money Market Securities that are deemed by the Adviser or Sub-Adviser to be of comparable quality to money market securities rated investment grade.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Derivative Instruments</HD>
        <P>The Fund may use derivative instruments as part of its investment strategies. Examples of derivative instruments include listed futures contracts,<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>forward currency contracts, non-deliverable forward currency contracts, currency and interest rate swaps, currency options, options on futures contracts, swap agreements and credit-linked notes.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/>The Fund's use of derivative instruments (other than credit-linked notes) will be collateralized or otherwise backed by investments in short term, high-quality U.S. money market securities. The Fund expects that no more than 30% of the value of the Fund's net assets will be invested in derivative instruments. Such investments will be consistent with the Fund's investment objective and will not be used to enhance leverage.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>14</SU>The listed futures contracts in which the Fund will invest may be listed on exchanges either in the U.S. or in either Hong Kong or Singapore. Both Hong Kong's primary financial markets regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, and Singapore's primary financial markets regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, are signatories to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (“MMOU”), which is a multi-party information sharing arrangement among major financial regulators. Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are signatories to the IOSCO MMOU.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>15</SU>The Fund may invest in credit-linked notes. A credit linked note is a type of structured note whose value is linked to an underlying reference asset. Credit linked notes typically provide periodic payments of interest as well as payment of principal upon maturity. The value of the periodic payments and the principal amount payable upon maturity are tied (positively or negatively) to a reference asset such as an index, government bond, interest rate or currency exchange rate. The ongoing payments and principal upon maturity typically will increase or decrease depending on increases or decreases in the value of the reference asset. The Fund's investments in credit-linked notes will be limited to notes providing exposure to Asian Fixed Income Securities. The Fund's overall investment in credit-linked notes will not exceed 25% of the Fund's assets.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>With respect to certain kinds of derivative transactions entered into by the Fund that involve obligations to make future payments to third parties, including, but not limited to, futures, forward contracts, swap contracts, the purchase of securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis, or reverse repurchase agreements, under applicable Federal securities laws, rules, and interpretations thereof, the Fund must “set aside” liquid assets, or engage in other measures to “cover” open positions with respect to such transactions.</P>
        <P>The Fund may engage in foreign currency transactions, and may invest directly in foreign currencies in the form of bank and financial institution deposits, certificates of deposit, and bankers acceptances denominated in a specified non-U.S. currency. The Fund may enter into forward currency contracts in order to “lock in” the exchange rate between the currency it will deliver and the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract.</P>

        <P>The Fund may enter into swap agreements, including interest rate swaps and currency swaps (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Hong Kong dollar vs. U.S. dollar), and may buy or sell put and call options on foreign currencies, either on exchanges or in the over-the-counter market. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with counterparties that are deemed to present acceptable credit risks, and may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which involve the sale of securities held by the Fund subject to its agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed upon date or upon demand and at a price reflecting a market rate of interest.</P>
        <P>The Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds and ETFs). The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 10% of its net assets in illiquid securities. Illiquid securities include securities subject to contractual or other restrictions on resale and other instruments that lack readily available markets.</P>
        <P>The Fund will not invest in non-U.S. equity securities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">The Shares</HD>

        <P>In addition, for the Fund, an estimated value, defined in Rule 8.600 as the “Portfolio Indicative Value,” that reflects an estimated intraday value of the Fund's portfolio, will be disseminated. The Portfolio Indicative Value will be based upon the current value for the components of the Disclosed Portfolio and will be updated and disseminated by one or more major market data vendors at least every 15 seconds during the Core Trading Session on the Exchange. In addition, during hours when the markets for Fixed Income Securities in the Fund's portfolio are closed, the Portfolio Indicative Value will be updated at least every 15 seconds during the Core Trading Session to reflect currency exchange fluctuations.</P>
        <P>The dissemination of the Portfolio Indicative Value, together with the Disclosed Portfolio, will allow investors to determine the value of the underlying portfolio of the Fund on a daily basis and to provide a close estimate of that value throughout the trading day.</P>
        <P>Information regarding market price and volume of the Shares is and will be continually available on a real-time basis throughout the day on brokers' computer screens and other electronic services.

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Trading Halts</HD>
        <P>With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in the Shares of the Fund. Shares of the Fund will be halted if the “circuit breaker” parameters in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.12 are reached. Trading may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which trading is not occurring in the securities and/or financial instruments comprising the Disclosed Portfolio of the Fund; or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. Trading in the Shares will be subject to Rule 8.600(d)(2)(D), which sets forth circumstances under which Shares of the Fund may be halted.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Trading Rules</HD>
        <P>The Exchange deems the Shares to be equity securities, thus rendering trading in the Shares subject to the Exchange's existing rules governing the trading of equity securities. Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca Marketplace from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time in accordance with NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.34 (Opening, Core, and Late Trading Sessions). The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions. As provided in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.6, Commentary .03, the minimum price variation (“MPV”) for quoting and entry of orders in equity securities traded on the NYSE Arca Marketplace is $0.01, with the exception of securities that are priced less than $1.00 for which the MPV for order entry is $0.0001.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Surveillance</HD>
        <P>The Exchange intends to utilize its existing surveillance procedures applicable to derivative products (which includes Managed Fund Shares) to monitor trading in the Shares. The Exchange represents that these procedures are adequate to properly monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable Federal securities laws.</P>
        <P>The Exchange's current trading surveillance focuses on detecting securities trading outside their normal patterns. When such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened, where appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading violations.</P>

Specifically, the Bulletin will discuss the following: (1) The procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Creation Unit aggregations (and that Shares are not individually redeemable); (2) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (3) the risks involved in trading the Shares during the Opening and Late Trading Sessions when an updated Portfolio Indicative Value will not be calculated or publicly disseminated; (4) how information regarding the Portfolio Indicative Value is disseminated; (5) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; and (6) trading information.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bulletin will reference that the Fund is subject to various fees and expenses described in the Registration Statement.

In addition, the listing and trading criteria set forth in Rule 8.600 are intended to protect investors and the public interest.</P>

        <P>If a Fund is successful in meeting its objective, its value (before fees and expenses) should gain approximately as much on a percentage basis as the level of its corresponding Index when it rises. Conversely, its value (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately as much on a percentage basis as the level of its corresponding Index when it declines. Each Fund will acquire exposure through VIX futures contracts traded on the CBOE Futures Exchange (“CFE”) (“VIX Futures Contracts”), such that each Fund has exposure intended to approximate the benchmark at the time of the net asset value (“NAV”) calculation.</P>
        <P>Each Fund will not be actively managed by traditional methods, which typically involve effecting changes in the composition of a portfolio on the basis of judgments relating to economic, financial, and market considerations with a view toward obtaining positive results under all market conditions. Rather, the Sponsor will seek to cause the NAV to track the performance of an Index, even during periods in which that benchmark is flat or moving in a manner which causes the NAV of a Fund to decline.</P>
        <P>The Indexes act as a measure of volatility as reflected by the price of certain VIX Futures Contracts (“Index Components”), with the price of each VIX Futures Contract reflecting the market's expectation of future volatility. Each Index seeks to reflect the returns that are potentially available from holding an unleveraged long position in certain VIX Futures Contracts. Unlike the Indexes, the VIX, which is not a benchmark for either Fund, is calculated based on the prices of put and call options on the S&amp;P 500, which are traded on the CBOE.</P>
        <P>The S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index employs rules for selecting the Index Components and a formula to calculate a level for the Index from the prices of these components. Specifically, the Index Components represent the prices of the two near-term VIX futures months, replicating a position that rolls the nearest month VIX Futures Contract to the next month VIX Futures Contract on a daily basis in equal fractional amounts. This results in a constant weighted average maturity of one month. The roll period begins on the Tuesday prior to the monthly CFE VIX Futures Contracts settlement date and runs through the Tuesday prior to the subsequent month's CFE VIX Futures Contract settlement date.</P>
        <P>The S&amp;P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index also employs rules for selecting the Index Components and a formula to calculate the level of the Index from the prices of these components. Specifically, the Index Components represent the prices for four contract months of VIX Futures Contracts, representing a market-based estimation of constant maturity, five-month forward implied VIX values. The S&amp;P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index measures the return from a rolling long position in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh month VIX Futures Contracts, and rolls continuously throughout each month while maintaining positions in the fifth and sixth month contracts. This results in a constant weighted average maturity of five months.</P>

          <FTREF/>and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.<SU>9</SU>
          <FTREF/>In particular, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/>which requires, among other things, that the Exchange's rules be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

          <FTREF/>which sets forth Congress' finding that it is in the<PRTPAGE P="201"/>public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Quotation and last-sale information regarding the Shares will be disseminated through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association. The level of each Index will be published at least every 15 seconds both in real-time from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time and at the close of trading on each Business Day<SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/>by Bloomberg L.P. and Reuters.<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/>The closing prices and settlement prices of the Index Components are available from the Web sites of the CFE, automated quotation systems, published or other public sources, and on-line information services such as Bloomberg or Reuters. The specific contract specifications for the component futures underlying the Indexes are also available on those Web sites, as well as on other financial informational sources. The CFE also provides delayed futures information on current and past trading sessions and market news free of charge on its Web site. In addition, the Funds will provide Web site disclosure of portfolio holdings daily and will include, as applicable, the notional value (in U.S. dollars) of VIX Futures Contracts and characteristics of such instruments and cash equivalents, and amount of cash held in the portfolio of the Funds. Further, NYSE Arca will calculate and disseminate every 15 seconds throughout the trading day an updated Indicative Optimized Portfolio Value (“IOPV”), which is an indicator of the value of the VIX Futures Contracts and cash and/or cash equivalents less liabilities of a Fund.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/>The NAV for the Funds' Shares will be calculated by the Administrator once a day,<SU>15</SU>

        <P>The Commission further believes that the proposal to list and trade the Shares is reasonably designed to promote fair disclosure of information that may be necessary to price the Shares appropriately and to prevent trading when a reasonable degree of transparency cannot be assured. The Commission notes that the Web site disclosure of the portfolio composition of the Funds will occur at the same time as the disclosure by the Funds of the portfolio composition to Authorized Participants so that all market participants are provided portfolio composition information at the same time. In addition, if the Exchange becomes aware that the NAV with respect to the Shares is not disseminated to all market participants at the same time, the Exchange will halt trading in the Shares until such time as the NAV is available to all market participants. Further, the Exchange may halt trading during the day in which an interruption to the dissemination to the IOPV, the value of the Index, the VIX, or the value of the underlying VIX Futures Contracts occurs. If such interruption persists past the trading day in which it occurred, the Exchange will halt trading no later than the beginning of the trading day following the interruption.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/>Trading in the Shares will be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.200, Commentary .02(e), which sets forth certain restrictions on ETP Holders acting as registered Market Makers in Trust Issued Receipts to facilitate surveillance. The Exchange represents that Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services LLC, the index sponsor with respect to the Indexes, has implemented procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material, non-public information regarding the Indexes.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>16</SU>Trading may also be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which trading is not occurring in the underlying futures contracts; or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange has represented that the Shares are deemed to be equity securities subject to the Exchange's existing rules governing the trading of equity securities. In support of this proposal, the Exchange has made representations, including:</P>
        <P>(1) The Funds will meet the initial and continued listing requirements applicable to Trust Issued Receipts in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.200 and Commentary .02 thereto.</P>
        <P>(2) The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions.</P>
        <P>(3) The Exchange's surveillance procedures are adequate to properly monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable Federal securities laws.</P>
        <P>(4) Prior to the commencement of trading, the Exchange will inform its ETP Holders in an Information Bulletin of the special characteristics and risks associated with trading the Shares. Specifically, the Information Bulletin will discuss the following: (a) The risks involved in trading the Shares during the Opening and Late Trading Sessions when an updated IOPV will not be calculated or publicly disseminated; (b) the procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets (and that Shares are not individually redeemable); (c) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (d) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; and (e) trading information.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Description and Text of the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>The proposed amendments to NFA Compliance Rule 2-9's Interpretive Notice entitled “Enhanced Supervisory Requirements” (“Notice”) would provide limited relief for some Members that currently would qualify for the enhanced supervisory requirements (“Requirements”) based on a firm principal's previous affiliation with another Member firm that was subject to the Requirements; makes changes to the enhanced capital requirements in light of a recent increase in the futures commission merchant (“FCM”) minimum capital requirement; makes changes to deal with the enhanced capital requirements for commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) in a manner more consistent with the nature of their business; requires specific items to be included in a firm's written supervisory procedures; requires quarterly rather than monthly reports on a firm's compliance with the Requirements; and includes clarifying language in three areas: (1) Charging abnormally high commissions and fees; (2) the effect that receiving a waiver has on determining whether a Member is a firm that has met the criteria for future situations involving the Requirements; and (3) the status of a “five year” Disciplined Firm after it has been dropped from the “five year” list.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Member firms trigger the Requirements based upon the regulatory background of either their associated persons (“APs”) or principals. Member firms triggering the Requirements must record all telephone conversations with customers and prospects, pre-submit promotional material, adopt written supervisory procedures and either operate under a guarantee agreement or maintain an enhanced capital level. The proposed amendments to the Notice include:</P>
        <P>• Limited relief for some Members that would currently qualify for the Requirements based on a firm principal's previous affiliation with another Member firm that was subject to the Requirements;</P>
        <P>• Changes to the enhanced capital requirements in light of a recent increase in the FCM minimum capital requirement;</P>
        <P>• Changes to deal with the enhanced capital requirements for CPOs and CTAs in a manner more consistent with the nature of their business;</P>
        <P>• Requiring specific items to be included in a firm's written supervisory procedures;</P>
        <P>• Requiring quarterly rather than monthly reports on a firm's compliance with the Requirements; and</P>
        <P>• Clarifying language regarding: (1) Charging abnormally high commissions and fees; (2) the effect that receiving a waiver has on future situations involving the Requirements; and (3) the status of a “five year” Disciplined Firm after it has been dropped from the “five year” list.</P>
        <P>Historically, a Member would trigger the Requirements only if it had a defined percentage of APs who had previously worked for a Disciplined Firm.</P>
        <P>In 2005, NFA's Board made revisions to the Notice after recognizing that the principals of several firms that had triggered the Requirements had avoided them by simply closing their firms and opening other firms that had a mix of APs that did not trigger the Requirements. NFA noted that the new firms typically had APs from the closed firm who had worked at Disciplined Firms, but their percentage ratios to the overall AP population of the new firms were below the triggering point for imposing the Requirements. NFA's Board addressed this issue by amending the Notice to provide that once a firm had triggered the Requirements, then any other firms of which the principals of the qualifying firm are also principals would become subject to the Requirements.</P>

        <P>NFA believes that the 2005 revision has been generally effective in discouraging the practice of sham reorganizations to avoid the Requirements. However, NFA has found<PRTPAGE P="203"/>that there were some principals whose firms triggered the Requirements with backgrounds that suggested they were not part of the population to which the amendment was designed to apply. NFA undertook the task of identifying objective criteria that were met by individuals who did not appear to be part of the target group but were, nevertheless, affected by the 2005 amendment. In doing so, NFA focused on criteria similar to those that have been adopted to provide exemptions to some APs who previously worked at Disciplined Firms. These criteria include a clean personal regulatory record and limited affiliation with potentially problematic Members.</P>
        <P>NFA has identified a set of five criteria that apply to approximately 60 individuals and approximately five entities that do not appear to raise undue concerns regarding their ability to effectively supervise their firms. Those criteria include the following:</P>
        <P>• The principal has not been personally subject to a disciplinary action by NFA or the CFTC;</P>
        <P>• The principal has been a principal of only one firm that has qualified for the Requirements;</P>
        <P>• The principal has never been a principal or an AP of a current Disciplined Firm;</P>
        <P>• The firm in the principal's history that triggered the Requirements either received a full waiver from the Requirements or abided by the Requirements for at least two years and is no longer subject to the Requirements; and</P>
        <P>• The firm in the principal's history that triggered the Requirements has not become subject to a sales practice action since triggering the Requirements.</P>
        <P>NFA believes that exempting Members from adopting the Requirements when those Requirements are triggered by a principal who meets the aforementioned five criteria would eliminate the need for some waiver petitions (which are typically granted), saving time and undue complications for the affected Members, the Telemarketing Procedures Waiver Committee (“Waiver Committee”) and NFA staff. NFA believes that this exemption could provide relief to certain principals whose profiles indicate that they are unlikely to pose any supervisory issues. In addition, NFA does not believe that this change will diminish customer protection because the principals that will be exempted are those principals who would almost always have been granted a waiver based on meeting the aforementioned criteria.</P>
        <P>The Notice currently provides that FCMs affected by the Notice are required to maintain adjusted net capital (“ANC”) of at least $1,000,000. When this provision was adopted the minimum ANC level was $500,000. However, the minimum ANC for all FCMs was raised to $1,000,000 in March 2010, rendering the current provision moot.</P>
        <P>NFA proposes to revise the language in the Notice regarding the enhanced level of ANC required to be maintained by affected FCMs to tie the required enhanced ANC to the minimum ANC for FCMs. The proposed amendments would track the approach taken by the Board in 2008 to deal with changes to the enhanced ANC provision for Forex Dealer Members (“FDMs”). Specifically, rather than set a defined number, it would tie the enhanced ANC level for FCMs to the early warning requirement under CFTC rules, which is currently 150% of required ANC. NFA believes that this revision would not only bring the current enhanced ANC obligation into harmony with that required of FDMs, but would also provide flexibility in light of any future changes to the level of the minimum ANC required of FCMs.</P>
        <P>The Notice currently requires CPOs and CTAs that trigger the Requirements to maintain ANC of at least $250,000. In addition, affected CPOs and CTAs are currently subject to the financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to FCMs.</P>
        <P>According to NFA, it is relatively uncommon for CPOs and CTAs to qualify for the Requirements, and if CPOs and CTAs do qualify, they often request relief from the $250,000 capital requirement even if they are required to tape. The Waiver Committee has dealt with ten waiver petitions from CPO or CTA Members and completely denied five of those petitions. Four of those firms are no longer NFA Members. The other five received partial waivers that reduced the enhanced ANC requirement. Two waivers set the required ANC level at $100,000, two set it at $75,000, and one eliminated the obligation altogether. Three of the five firms that received waivers remain NFA Members. In granting these petitions, the Waiver Committee recognized that because CPOs and CTAs do not have a minimum net capital requirement, imposing the reduced $100,000 requirement was sufficient to meet the purpose of the requirement.</P>
        <P>In light of the Waiver Committee's past decisions regarding this issue, NFA proposes to amend the Notice to reduce the ANC required of CPOs and CTAs that trigger the Requirements from the current $250,000 to $100,000. In addition, the proposed amendments to the Notice would provide that the financial recordkeeping and reporting obligations of affected CPOs and CTAs be simplified by merely requiring them to demonstrate compliance with their enhanced ANC obligation to NFA upon request.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendments to the Notice identify specific areas that would need to be addressed by an affected Member in the written supervisory procedures they are required to prepare. NFA believes that this addition will give clear guidance as to the minimum standards to be met in preparing written supervisory procedures. Generally, the proposed language requires procedures for monitoring, cataloging and logging taped conversations in an affected Member's written supervisory procedures.</P>
        <P>The Notice currently requires affected Members to file monthly reports regarding their compliance with the Requirements. It has been NFA's experience in reviewing these reports that most of them tend to be repetitious in nature. Nevertheless, NFA feels that the reports are useful in that they periodically bring the Member's focus to bear on the Requirements, create a written historical record and, on occasion, may provide the impetus for corrective action by the Member. NFA proposes to change the frequency of the obligation to file such reports from monthly to quarterly. NFA believes that lengthening the frequency for filing the reports will not in any way diminish customer protection because the reports alone do not typically form the basis of an NFA investigation or disciplinary action. Moreover, NFA uses other methods to monitor Member compliance with the Requirements.</P>

        <P>Members that charge 50% or more of their active customers round-turn commissions, fees and other charges that total $100 or more per futures, forex or option contract are required to adopt the Requirements. NFA represents that it has recently encountered situations in which Members purchase out-of-the-money options and charge a commission just short of $100. In these situations there are additional charges if the option is liquidated that would bring total charges above $100; however, NFA believes that it is often the case that the out-of-the-money options expire worthless and no additional costs are assessed. The result is that some Members are able to avoid the Requirements by encouraging their customers to take on riskier out-of-the-money positions that are less likely to<PRTPAGE P="204"/>incur liquidation charges that would raise costs to $100 or more.</P>
        <P>Members that engage in the practice described above are, in NFA's view, clearly within the group of Members that the Board believed should be subject to the Requirements when it chose to use high commissions and fees as a trigger for imposing the Requirements. Therefore, the proposed amendments to the Notice provide that trading an options contract that would result in total commissions, fees and other charges of $100 or more if the trade was liquidated will be deemed to have been charged $100 even if the contract is not ultimately liquidated.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendments to the Notice would add language that NFA believes would clarify that a Member that receives a full or partial waiver is still deemed to be a Member that has met the criteria for purposes of the Notice.</P>
        <P>From 1993 until 2007, the term “Disciplined Firm” included only Members that had been permanently barred from the industry as the result of a sales practice or promotional material action. In 2007, the amendments to the Notice added Members that had been sanctioned in any way in a sales practice or promotional material action within the preceding five years to the definition of a Disciplined Firm. This resulted in the creation of a list of “five year” Disciplined Firms that is separate from the list of permanent Disciplined Firms. The electronic reporting system that monitors Disciplined Firms automatically removes these firms from the Disciplined Firm list once five years have passed.</P>
        <P>According to NFA, there has been some confusion expressed as to whether a “five year” Disciplined Firm is still considered to be a Disciplined Firm for purposes of triggering the Requirements once the firm is dropped from the “five year” list. NFA believes that the proposed amendments to the Notice would eliminate this confusion by simply adding the word “current” before the term “Disciplined Firm” in four relevant places in Section III (B)(1) of the Notice.</P>
        <P>Amendments to the Interpretive Notice regarding NFA Compliance Rule 2-9: Enhanced Supervisory Requirements were previously filed with the SEC in SR-NFA-2003-01, Exchange Act Release No. 34-47533 (Mar. 19, 2003), 68 FR 14733 (Mar. 26, 2003); SR-NFA-2005-01, Exchange Act Release No. 34-52808 (Nov. 18, 2005), 70 FR 71347 (Nov. 28, 2005); SR-NFA-2006-01, Exchange Act Release No. 34-53568 (Mar. 29, 2006), 71 FR 16850 (Apr. 4, 2006); SR-NFA-2007-03, Exchange Act Release No. 34-55710 (May 4, 2007), 72 FR 26858 (May 11, 2007); SR-NFA-2007-07, Exchange Act Release No. 34-57142 (Jan. 14, 2008), 73 FR 3502 (Jan. 18, 2008); and SR-NFA-2008-01, Exchange Act Release No. 34-57640 (Apr. 9, 2008), 73 FR 20341 (Apr. 15, 2008).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>NFA believes that the proposed rule change is authorized by, and consistent with, Section 15A(k)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/>That section sets out requirements for rules of futures associations, registered under Section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act,<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/>that are a registered national securities association for the limited purpose of regulating the activities of members who are registered as brokers or dealers in security futures products pursuant to Section 15(b)(11) of the Exchange Act. Under Section 15A(k)(2)(B), the rules of such a limited purpose national securities association must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, including rules governing sales practices and the advertising of security futures products reasonably comparable to the rules of a registered national securities association applicable to security futures products. NFA believes the proposed rule change would meet these requirements by: Providing limited relief for some Members that would currently qualify for the Requirements based on a principal's previous affiliation with another Member firm that was subject to the Requirements; changing the enhanced capital requirements in light of a recent increase in the FCM minimum capital requirement; changing the enhanced capital requirements for CPOs and CTAs in a manner more consistent with the nature of their business; requiring specific items to be included in a firm's written supervisory procedures; requiring quarterly rather than monthly reports on a firm's compliance with the Requirements; and clarifying language regarding—charging abnormally high commissions and fees; the effect that receiving a waiver has on determining whether a Member is a firm that has met the criteria for futures situation involving the Requirements; and the status of a “five year” Disciplined Firm after it has been dropped from the “five year” list.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
        <P>NFA believes that the portion of the proposed rule change that exempts Members from adopting the Requirements when those Requirements are triggered by a principal who meets the specified five criteria should lessen the burden on competition by eliminating the need for waiver requests that are typically granted and decreasing the number of firms that are subject to the requirement by automatically exempting firms that qualify based on principals whose profiles indicate that they are unlikely to pose supervisory problems.</P>
        <P>NFA does not believe that the proposed changes to CPO and CTA capital requirements and reporting requirements for firms that trigger the Requirements would impose any burden on competition.</P>
        <P>Although the proposed rule change would require FCMs subject to the Requirements to maintain additional capital, NFA believes that the increase is necessary in order to maintain the purpose behind the Requirements, and is also consistent with the approach NFA adopted with respect to FDMs. The minimum capital level for all FCMs was recently increased to $1,000,000, which is the same amount currently required of FCMs subject to the enhanced requirement. In order for the enhanced Requirements to maintain their original purpose, NFA believes that the capital requirement must be increased. Rather than setting another fixed dollar amount, the proposed amendment would tie the required enhanced ANC to the early warning requirement under CFTC rules (150% of minimum ANC). This revision would impose the same standard on FCM and FDM Members and take into consideration any future changes to ANC levels.</P>
        <P>The proposed rule change identifies specific areas that need to be addressed by an affected Member in the written supervisory procedures it is currently required to prepare. NFA represents that the changes would not impose additional substantive requirements on Members. Rather, NFA believes this language would address requests for Members for specific guidance on how to comply with their obligation to monitor, catalog and log taped conversations. Therefore, NFA does not believe this change imposes any burden on competition.</P>

        <P>The current rule requires Members that charge 50% or more of their active customers round-turn commissions, fees and other charges that total $100 or more per futures, forex or option<PRTPAGE P="205"/>contract to adopt the Requirements. NFA has identified a trend where some Members encourage their customers to take on riskier out-of-the money options at a cost just below $100. Because in NFA's view these positions are much less likely to be liquidated and charged a liquidation fee, the total cost remains under the $100 threshold. NFA states that the proposed rule change may increase the number of Members subject to the Requirements because option contracts that would result in total commission, fees and other charges of $100 or more if the trade was liquidated will be deemed to have been charged $100 even if the trade is not liquidated. NFA believes that the additional burden is necessary, however, because Members that engage in this practice are clearly within the group of Members that NFA's Board believed should be subject to the enhanced Requirements when it chose to use high commissions and fees as a trigger for imposing the Requirements.</P>
        <P>NFA believes that the proposed provision that changes a Member's reporting obligation with respect to its report on compliance with the Requirements will also lessen the burden on Members. Under this provision, a Member will be permitted to file this report on a quarterly rather than monthly basis.</P>
        <P>NFA believes that the final two proposed revisions do not add any burden to competition because they are merely clarifying current requirements. One proposed rule change would add language that NFA believes makes it clear that a Member that receives a full or partial waiver is still deemed to be a Member that has met the criteria for purposes of the Notice. Another proposed rule change would add the word “current” before the term “Disciplined Firm” in four relevant places in order to clarify that a “five year” Disciplined Firm will no longer be a Disciplined Firm for purposes of triggering the Requirements once the firm is dropped from the “five year” list.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others</HD>
        <P>NFA states that it worked with its Member Advisory Committees in developing the rule change. NFA did not, however, publish the rule change to its membership for comment. NFA states that it did not receive comment letters concerning the rule change.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action</HD>
        <P>On October 20, 2010, the CFTC notified NFA that it had approved the rule change, and therefore, NFA is permitted to make the amendments effective as of this date.</P>
        <P>Within 60 days of the date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change, the Commission, after consultation with the CFTC, may summarily abrogate the proposed rule change and require that the proposed rule change be refiled in accordance with the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Act.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Solicitation of Comments</HD>
        <P>Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Exchange Act. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:</P>

These beneficiaries and recipients can use Form SSA-632-BK to take one of three actions: (1) Request an exemption from repaying, as recovery of the payment would cause financial hardship; (2) inform SSA they want to repay the overpayment at a monthly rate over a period longer than 36 months; and (3) request a different rate of recovery. In the latter two cases, the respondents must also provide financial information to SSA to help the agency determine how much the overpaid person can afford to repay each month.

At least 25 percent of<PRTPAGE P="207"/>the SPR funds apportioned annually must be used for research, development, and technology transfer activities. In accordance with government-wide grant management procedures, a grant application must be submitted for these funds. In addition, recipients must submit periodic progress and financial reports. In lieu of Standard Form 424, Application for Federal Assistance, the FHWA uses a work program as the grant application. The information contained in the work program includes task descriptions, assignments of responsibility for conducting the work effort, and estimated costs for the tasks. This information is necessary to determine how FHWA planning and research funds will be utilized by the State Transportation Departments and if the proposed work is eligible for Federal participation. The content and frequency of submission of progress and financial reports specified in 23 CFR part 420 are specified in OMB Circular A-102 and the companion common grant management regulations.</P>

          <P>The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), as the lead Federal agency, and the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) intend to prepare a Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement (Tier 1 EIS) for the North Red and Purple Line Modernization (RPM) Project in Cook County, Illinois. The CTA operates the rapid transit system in Cook County, Illinois. The proposed project, described more completely within, would bring the North Red and Purple lines up to a state of good repair from the track structure immediately north of Belmont Station in Chicago, Illinois to the Linden terminal in Wilmette, Illinois. The purpose of this Notice of Intent is to (1) alert interested parties regarding the intent to prepare the EIS, (2) to provide information on the nature of the proposed project and possible alternatives, and (3) to invite public participation in the EIS process.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scoping</HD>
        <P>The FTA and CTA invite all interested individuals and organizations, public agencies, and Native American Tribes to comment on the scope of the Tier 1 EIS, including the project's purpose and need, the alternatives to be studied, the impacts to be evaluated, and the evaluation methods to be used. The Tier 1 EIS will be a planning level EIS that will allow the CTA and FTA to use the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process as a tool to involve agencies and the public in the decision making process for the project as well as to capture any associated or cumulative impacts on the environment. This process will ensure that: the complete 9.5-mile RPM corridor is analyzed; the EIS is used to help refine and prioritize design concepts, and; related components of the project are grouped together for future analysis. After this Tier 1 EIS process is complete, component projects can each be evaluated more specifically with a second-tier EIS and/or other NEPA environmental documentation as needed. These ensuing NEPA documents can reference and summarize information from the Tier 1 EIS and concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent actions (40 CFR 1502.20). Comments should address (1) the project's priorities and appropriate cost-effective alternatives and components, and (2) any significant environmental impacts relating to the alternatives.</P>

        <P>NEPA “scoping” (40 CFR 1501.7) has specific and fairly limited objectives, one of which is to identify the<PRTPAGE P="208"/>significant issues associated with alternatives that will be examined in detail in the Tier 1 EIS, while simultaneously limiting consideration and development of issues that are not truly significant. It is in the NEPA scoping process that potentially significant environmental impacts—those that give rise to the need to prepare an environmental impact statement—should be identified; impacts that are deemed not to be significant need not be developed extensively in the context of the impact statement, thereby keeping the statement focused on impacts of consequence. Transit projects may also generate environmental benefits; these should be highlighted as well—the impact statement process should draw attention to positive impacts, not just negative impacts.</P>
        <P>Once the scoping process is completed, a scoping report and annotated outline will be prepared and shared with interested agencies and the public. The report and outline serves at least three worthy purposes, including (1) documenting the results of the scoping process; (2) contributing to the transparency of the process; and (3) providing a clear roadmap for concise development of the environmental document.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Purpose and Need for the Project</HD>
        <P>The purpose of the North Red and Purple Line Modernization project is to bring the existing crucial transit asset into a state of good repair, while reducing travel times, improving access to job markets, responding to shifts in travel demand, better utilizing existing transit infrastructure and providing access to persons with disabilities in the north lakefront and north suburbs of Chicago. This project would also support the area's economic development initiatives and current transit supportive development patterns.</P>
        <P>The need for the project is based on the following considerations: the North Red and Purple Line infrastructure is significantly past its useful life as most of it was constructed between 1900 and 1922; much of the infrastructure is dilapidated and continued degradation could increase the cost of maintenance and compromise service in the future; transit trips are delayed and unreliable due to antiquated infrastructure; the community relies on these facilities for all trip types including work access and reverse commutes; 15 of the 21 stations within the project area do not have access for persons with disabilities; the volume of passengers, over 128,000 trips on an average weekday representing over 19% of all weekday and 23% of all weekend CTA rail trips, could not be accommodated either on the currently congested road network or through bus transportation alternatives; and the project area population is growing, highly transit-reliant, and diverse.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Project Location and Environmental Setting</HD>
        <P>The project area extends from the track structure immediately north of Belmont station to Linden station, which is approximately 9.5 miles and includes 21 stations and two rail yards, the Howard Yard and the Linden Yard. Currently, the Red and Purple Lines operate beside each other on 4 tracks for 5.7 miles from north of Belmont station to Howard station, of which 1.9 miles is located on steel elevated structure and 3.8 miles on earthen embankment. The Purple Line operates alone on 2 tracks for 3.8 miles from Howard station to Linden station on earthen embankment.</P>
        <P>The project area traverses dense urban single and multi family residential, commercial, and educational land uses and includes portions of Chicago's North Side, Evanston, and Wilmette, Illinois. The project area includes numerous parks and cemeteries, and crosses the North Shore Channel of the Chicago River.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternatives</HD>
        <P>Several alternatives are proposed for analysis in the EIS. Public input received during scoping will help to select, reject and/or revise the following alternatives.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">No Action Alternative:</E>The No Action Alternative would maintain the status quo. This alternative would include the absolute minimum repairs required to keep the Red and Purple lines functional. Travel patterns would remain the same. Travel times would likely continue to increase and service reliability would continue to degrade due to the need to safely operate on systems not considered in a state of good repair. Additional ADA access would not be provided. Minor repairs and upgrades would be made using current capital funding levels. The number of stations and station entrances would remain at 21 and 23, respectively. No stations would be renovated. The No Action Alternative is used as a basis for comparison for the other alternatives.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Basic Rehabilitation Alternative:</E>This alternative includes a strategic mix of repairs, rehabilitation, and replacement to bring the Evanston Branch (between Linden Terminal and Howard Station) and the North Red Line (between Belmont Station and Howard Station) into a minimal state of good repair. It would provide adequate service for the next 20 years. The stations, viaducts, and other structural elements would not be brought up to modern standards and would only meet minimal ADA requirements. Upgrades would be made to signals and communication systems. The number of stations and station entrances would remain at 21 and 23, respectively.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Evanston Branch:</E>The Evanston Branch, between Linden Terminal and Howard Station, is the northern section of the study area and is approximately 3.8 miles long. This segment currently has 2 operating tracks with 8 stations (not including Howard). Only one station would be renovated to accommodate 8 car trains; two stations which are already accessible would receive minor repairs; the other six stations would be renovated to meet minimal ADA requirements. This alternative consists of upgrades to existing structures primarily within the existing CTA right-of-way and maintenance of the existing overall track alignment, structure, and station configurations.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">North Red Line:</E>The North Red Line, between Belmont Station and Howard Station, is the southern section of the study area and is approximately 5.8 miles long. This segment currently has 4 operating tracks with 13 stations. Eight stations would be renovated to meet minimal ADA requirements; one station would be reconstructed; the remaining four stations are already accessible and would receive minor repairs. This alternative consists of upgrades to existing structures primarily within the existing CTA right-of-way and maintaining the existing overall track alignment, structure, and station configurations. Express service with no stops between Howard and Belmont would continue to be provided in both directions during peak periods.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Basic Rehabilitation with Transfer Stations Alternative:</E>This alternative includes all of the elements of the Basic Rehabilitation Alternative plus new transfer stations at Wilson and Loyola. The number of stations would remain at 21 and the total number of station entrances would increase to 25.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Evanston Branch:</E>Same as Basic Rehabilitation Alternative above in this segment for this alternative.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">North Red Line:</E>This alternative includes all of the elements of the Basic Rehabilitation Alternative plus new transfer stations at Wilson and Loyola. The new transfer stations and 1 mile of associated structures would have a useful life of 60-80 years; the rest of the improvements would have a useful life<PRTPAGE P="209"/>of 20 years. Additional access to express service would be possible at the two new transfer stations. This alternative would allow for potential expanded hours of express service. Seven stations would be renovated to meet minimal ADA requirements; three stations would be reconstructed (two as transfer stations); the remaining three stations are already accessible and would receive minor repairs.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Modernization 4-Track Alternative:</E>This alternative would provide modern amenities at stations, extend the useful life of the system for the next 60-80 years, increase speed and reliability, and address safety and accessibility concerns. This alternative would require significant right-of-way acquisitions. The number of stations would decrease to 17 and the total number of station entrances would increase to 31.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Evanston Branch:</E>All stations would be reconstructed or renovated to meet modern standards for accessibility and safety including modern platform widths and clear lines of sight, in addition to being expanded to accommodate 8 car trains. Four stations would be reconstructed; the remaining two previously-modernized stations would receive minor repairs. Reconstruction of elevated structures and viaducts would bring them up to modern standards including clearances for cross streets underneath viaducts. Minimal acquisition would be required to straighten curves that currently slow service. The potential exists to consolidate stops while providing additional access points; examples of this could include: Adding a Washington entrance to Main station and removing South Blvd station; and adding a Gaffield entrance to Noyes station and a Church entrance to Davis station and removing Foster station.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">North Red Line:</E>All stations would be reconstructed or renovated to meet modern standards for accessibility and safety including modern platform widths and clear lines of sight. Nine stations would be reconstructed (two as transfer stations); the remaining one previously-modernized station would receive minor repairs. This alternative would provide express and local service in both directions by maintaining 4-tracks and would replace the existing structures and embankment with modern concrete aerial structure. This alternative would allow for potential expanded hours of express service. Substantial additional right-of-way would be required to increase platform widths and provide clear lines of sight, as well as to straighten curves that slow service. The potential exists to consolidate stops, while providing additional access points; examples of this could include: Adding an Ainslie entrance to Argyle station and removing Lawrence station; adding a Glenlake entrance to Granville station and a Hollywood entrance to Bryn Mawr station and removing Thorndale station; and providing additional access to Howard station at Rogers Avenue and removing Jarvis station.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Modernization 3-Track Alternative:</E>This alternative would provide modern amenities at stations, extend the useful life of the system for the next 60-80 years, increase speed and reliability, and address safety and accessibility concerns. This alternative would remove one of the four tracks in the North Red Line corridor. The number of stations would decrease to 17 and the total number of station entrances would increase to 31. The number of stations to be reconstructed and repaired would be the same as the Modernization 4-Track Alternative above.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Evanston Branch:</E>Same as Modernization 4-Track Alternative above in this segment for this alternative.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">North Red Line:</E>All stations would be reconstructed or renovated to meet modern standards for accessibility and safety including modern platform widths and clear lines of sight. This alternative would generally stay within the existing right-of-way, would eliminate one of the four existing tracks between Belmont and Howard to accommodate wider platforms, and would replace the existing structures and embankment with modern concrete aerial structure. Local service would be offered in both directions at all times and express service would be offered inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening; no reverse commute express service would be provided. Some right-of-way acquisition would be required to straighten curves that currently slow service. The potential exists to consolidate stops, while providing additional access points; possibilities would be the same as for the Modernization 4-Track Alternative above.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Modernization 2-Track Underground Alternative:</E>This alternative would provide modern amenities at stations, extend the useful life of the system for the next 60-80 years, increase speed and reliability, and address safety and accessibility concerns. This alternative would operate underground in a new 2-track alignment in place of the current 4-track alignment in the North Red Line segment. The number of stations would decrease to 16 and the total number of station entrances would increase to 29.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Evanston Branch:</E>Same as Modernization 4-Track Alternative above in this segment for this alternative.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">North Red Line:</E>This alternative would replace a significant portion of the existing 4-track elevated rail structure and embankment with a below-grade 2-track alignment. This alternative would provide a single more frequent local service in both directions between Linden and Belmont in this corridor; no express overlay service would be provided. The alternative alignment would begin north of Belmont and transition below ground, proceeding underneath the northbound Brown Line tracks. The alignment would continue northward generally following Sheffield/Sheridan to the intersection of Sheridan and Broadway, and then proceed north underneath Broadway until it transitions back to the elevated alignment just north of Loyola. Subway stations would be constructed at Addison, Irving Park, Wilson, Foster, Bryn Mawr, Glenlake, and Devon/Loyola. In total, seven modern stations would be constructed underground; one station would be reconstructed above ground; one previously-modernized station would receive minor repairs. The current 4-track earthen embankment between Loyola and Howard would be replaced with a 2-track modern concrete aerial structure. This alternative would require right-of-way acquisition outside of the existing Red Line alignment for station entrances and auxiliary structures. Curves would be straightened and new subway stops would be located to maximize train speed. The potential exists in the remaining elevated alignment to provide additional access to Howard station at Rogers Avenue and remove Jarvis station.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Possible Effects</HD>

        <P>The purpose of this Tier 1 EIS process is to study, in a public setting, the effects of the proposed project and its alternatives on the quality of the human and natural environment. Areas of investigation for transit projects generally include, but are not limited to: Land use, development potential, land acquisition and displacements, historic resources, visual and aesthetic qualities, air quality, noise and vibration, energy use, safety and security, and ecosystems, including threatened and endangered species. Investigation may reveal that the proposed project will or will not substantially affect many of these areas. Measures will be identified to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any significant adverse impacts.<PRTPAGE P="210"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">FTA Procedures</HD>

        <P>The regulations implementing NEPA, as well as provisions of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), calls for public involvement in the EIS process. Section 6002 of SAFETEA-LU requires that FTA and CTA do the following: (1) Extend an invitation to other Federal and non-Federal agencies and Native American Tribes that may have an interest in the proposed project to become “participating agencies;” (2) provide an opportunity for involvement by participating agencies and the public to help define the purpose and need for a proposed project, as well as the range of alternatives for consideration in the EIS; and (3) establish a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in, and comment on, the environmental review process. An invitation to become a participating or cooperating agency, with scoping materials appended, will be extended to other Federal and non-Federal agencies and Native American Tribes that may have an interest in the proposed project. It is possible that FTA and CTA will not be able to identify all Federal and non-Federal agencies and Native American Tribes that may have such an interest. Any Federal or non-Federal agency or Native American Tribe interested in the proposed project that does not receive an invitation to become a participating agency should notify at the earliest opportunity the Project Manager identified above under<E T="02">ADDRESSES.</E>
        </P>

        <P>A comprehensive public involvement program and a Coordination Plan for public and interagency involvement will be developed for the project and posted on CTA's Web site,<E T="03">http://www.transitchicago.com/rpmproject.</E>The public involvement program includes a full range of activities including maintaining the project Web page on the CTA Web site and outreach to local officials, community and civic groups, and the public. Specific activities or events for involvement will be detailed in the project's public participation plan.</P>
        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act seeks, in part, to minimize the cost to the taxpayer of the creation, collection, maintenance, use, dissemination, and disposition of information. Consistent with this goal and with principles of economy and efficiency in government, it is FTA policy to limit insofar as possible distribution of complete printed sets of environmental documents. Accordingly, unless a specific request for a complete printed set of environmental documents is received (preferably in advance of printing), FTA and its grantees will distribute only the executive summary of the environmental document together with a Compact Disc of the complete environmental document. A complete printed set of the environmental document will be available for review at the CTA's offices and elsewhere; an electronic copy of the complete environmental document will also be available on the CTA's Web page.</P>
        <P>The EIS will be prepared in accordance with NEPA and its implementing regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and with the FTA/Federal Highway Administration regulations “Environmental Impact and Related Procedures” (23 CFR Part 771).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</HD>

        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before a proposed collection of information is submitted to OMB for approval, Federal agencies must first publish a document in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>providing a 60-day comment period and otherwise consult with<PRTPAGE P="211"/>members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information. The OMB has promulgated regulations describing what must be included in such a document. Under OMB's regulation (at 5 CFR 1320.8(d)), an agency must ask for public comment on the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;</P>
        <P>(ii) The accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
        <P>(iii) How to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected;</P>
        <P>(iv) How to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g. permitting electronic submission of responses.</P>
        <P>In compliance with these requirements, NHTSA asks for public comments on the following proposed collection of information:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Title:</E>Consolidated Labeling Requirements for Motor Vehicles (except the VIN).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">OMB Control Number:</E>2127-0512.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Requested Expiration Date of Approval:</E>Three years from the approval date.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Type of Request:</E>Extension of a currently approved collection.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Affected Public:</E>Businesses.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Summary of the Collection of Information:</E>49 U.S.C. 30111 authorizes the issuance of Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and regulations. The agency, in prescribing a FMVSS or regulations, considers available relevant motor vehicle safety data, and consults with other agencies, as it deems appropriate. Further, the statute mandates that in issuing any FMVSS or regulation, the agency considers whether the standard or regulation is “reasonable, practicable and appropriate for the particular type of motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed,” and whether such a standard will contribute to carrying out the purpose of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Secretary is authorized to invoke such rules and regulations, as deemed necessary to carry out these requirements. Using this authority, the agency issued the following FMVSS and regulations, specifying labeling requirements to aid the agency in achieving many of its safety goals:</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 105, “Hydraulic and electric brake systems,”</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 135, “Light vehicle brake systems,”</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 205, “Glazing materials,”</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 209, “Seat belt assemblies,” and</P>
        <P>Part 567, “Certification.”</P>
        <P>This notice requests comments on the labeling requirements of these FMVSS and regulations.</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 105, “Hydraulic and electric brake systems” and FMVSS No. 135, “Light vehicle brake systems,” require that each vehicle shall have a brake fluid warning statement in letters at least one-eighth of an inch high on the master cylinder reservoirs and located so as to be visible by direct view.</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 205, “Glazing materials,” provides labeling requirements for glazing and motor vehicle manufacturers. In accordance with the standard, NHTSA requires each new motor vehicle glazing manufacturer to request and be assigned a unique mark or number. This number is then used by the manufacturer as their unique company identification on their self-certification label on each piece of motor vehicle glazing. As part of that certification label, the company must identify with the simple two or three digit number assigned by the agency and the model of the glazing. In addition to these requirements, which apply to all glazing, certain specialty glazing items, such as standee windows in buses, roof openings, and interior partitions made of plastic require that the manufacturer affix a removable label to each item. The label specifies cleaning instructions, which will minimize the loss of transparency. Other information may be provided by the manufacturer but is not required.</P>
        <P>FMVSS No. 209, “Seat belt assemblies,” requires safety belts to be labeled with the year of manufacture, the model, and the name or trademark of the manufacturer (S4.1(j)). Additionally replacement safety belts that are for use only in specifically stated motor vehicles must have labels or accompanying instruction sheets to specify the applicable vehicle models and seating positions (S4.1(k)). All other replacement belts are required to be accompanied by an installation instruction sheet (S4.1(k)).</P>
        <P>Seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment in new motor vehicles need not be required to be labeled with position/model information. This information is only useful if the assembly is removed with the intention of using the assembly as a replacement in another vehicle; this is not a common practice.</P>
        <P>Part 567, “Certification,” requires each manufacturer or distributor of motor vehicles to furnish to the dealer, or distributor of the vehicle, a certification that the vehicle meets all applicable FMVSS. This certification is required by that provision to be in the form of a label permanently affixed to the vehicle. Under 49 U.S.C. 32504, vehicle manufacturers are directed to make a similar certification with regard to bumper standards. To implement this requirement, NHTSA issued 49 CFR Part 567. The agency's regulations establish form and content requirements for the certification labels.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Description of the Likely Respondents (Including Estimated Number and Proposed Frequency of Response to the Collection of Information):</E>NHTSA anticipates that approximately 25 new prime glazing manufactures per year will contact the agency and request a manufacturer identification number. These new glazing manufacturers must submit one letter, one time, identifying their company. In turn, the agency responds by assigning them a unique manufacturer number. For other collections in this notice, no response is necessary from manufacturers. These labels are only required to be placed on each master cylinder reservoir, each safety belt and every motor vehicle intended for retain sale in the United Sates. Therefore, the number of respondents is not applicable.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimate of the Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden Resulting from the Collection of Information:</E>NHTSA estimates that all manufacturers will need a total of 74,096 hours to comply with these requirements, at a total annual cost of 1,481,920.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comments are invited on:</E>Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Department, including whether the information will have practical utility; the accuracy of the Department's estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection; ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected; and ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</P>

            <P>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) proposes to amend its existing regulations governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The majority of the changes are proposed for the categorical exclusions provisions contained in its NEPA Implementing Procedures, with a small number of related changes proposed for other provisions. These proposed changes are intended to better align the Department's regulations, particularly its categorical exclusions, with DOE's current activities and recent experiences, and to update the provisions with respect to current technologies and regulatory requirements. DOE proposes to establish 20 new categorical exclusions, and to remove two categorical exclusion categories, one environmental assessment (EA) category, and two environmental impact statement (EIS) categories. Other proposed changes modify and clarify DOE's existing provisions.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction and Background</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">What is NEPA?</HD>

          <P>The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires Federal agencies to consider the potential environmental impacts of their “proposed actions” before taking action. (Please note the terms “effects” and “impacts” as used in this proposed rule are synonymous.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 1508.8.) Proposed actions include actions directly undertaken by a Federal agency, as well as certain actions undertaken by a State, local, or private entity with Federal involvement,<E T="03">e.g.,</E>certain projects that may receive Federal funding, permits, or other support.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">What is environmental review under NEPA?</HD>

          <P>The Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ's) NEPA implementing regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) establish three levels of review for proposed actions—EIS, EA, and categorical exclusion determinations—each involving different levels of information and analysis. An EIS is a detailed analysis of the potential environmental impacts of a proposed action (and alternatives) that may have a significant impact on the environment.<E T="03">See</E>NEPA Section 102(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C); 40 CFR 1508.11. An EA is a briefer analysis conducted to determine whether a proposed action may have a significant impact on the environment and thus whether an EIS is required.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 1508.9. A categorical exclusion is a class of actions that a Federal agency has determined do not, absent extraordinary circumstances, individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment and for which, therefore, neither an EA nor an EIS is required.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 1508.4. A categorical exclusion determination is made when an agency finds that a proposed action fits within a categorical exclusion and meets other applicable requirements, such as the absence of extraordinary circumstances.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">How does DOE establish categorical exclusions?</HD>
          <P>DOE establishes categorical exclusions pursuant to a rulemaking, such as this one, for defined classes of actions that the Department determines are supported by a record showing that they normally will not have significant environmental impacts, individually or cumulatively. DOE establishes categorical exclusions based on its experience, the experience of other agencies, and information provided by the public.</P>
          <P>A complete list of DOE's current categorical exclusions can be found at 10 CFR part 1021, subpart D, appendices A and B. Appendix A lists categorical exclusions applicable to general agency actions (for example, routine administrative, financial, and personnel actions). Appendix B lists categorical exclusions that are applicable to specific agency actions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">How does DOE make a categorical exclusion determination?</HD>

          <P>Under the regulations, before a proposed action may be categorically excluded, DOE must determine in accordance with 10 CFR 1021.410(b) that: (1) The proposed action fits within<PRTPAGE P="215"/>a class of actions listed in appendix A or B to subpart D, (2) there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental impacts of the proposed action, and (3) there are no connected or related actions with cumulatively significant impacts and, as appropriate, the proposed action is not precluded as an impermissible interim action (40 CFR 1506.1 and 10 CFR 1021.211).</P>
          <P>In addition, to fit within a class of actions in appendix B, a proposed action must satisfy certain conditions known as “integral elements” (appendix B, paragraphs (1) through (4)). Briefly, these conditions ensure that an excluded action would not have the potential to cause significant environmental impacts due to, for example, a threatened violation of applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements, or by disturbing hazardous substances such that there would be uncontrolled or unpermitted releases.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">What does DOE propose to change in its NEPA regulations?</HD>
          <P>With this proposed rule, DOE proposes to update its NEPA regulations (10 CFR part 1021), primarily with changes to subpart D and with a few changes to subpart C. Most changes are to categorical exclusions (subpart D, appendices A and B, discussed in Sections IV.D and IV.E below, respectively), including establishing new categorical exclusions and modifying existing categorical exclusions. DOE also proposes to make changes to its classes of actions that normally require an EA (appendix C, discussed in Section IV.F) or EIS (appendix D, discussed in Section IV.G). In addition, DOE proposes to change several procedural provisions of the Department's regulations (Section IV.C) and modify wording for consistency and clarity (Section IV.B).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Purpose and Development of the Proposed Changes</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Why does DOE propose to amend its NEPA implementing procedures?</HD>
          <P>The Department last updated its categorical exclusions in 1996. Since that time, the range of activities in which DOE is involved has changed and expanded. For example, in recent years, DOE has received more applications for financial support from private applicants for actions that promote energy efficiency and energy independence. DOE has received thousands of applications under grant and loan programs established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Another change since 1996 is the growth and development of new technologies in the private and public sectors, including energy efficient and renewable energy technologies, and DOE's experience with those technologies. Through this proposed rulemaking, DOE proposes to update its categorical exclusions to address the Department's current activities and its experience and bring the provisions up-to-date with current technology and regulatory requirements.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">How did DOE seek input on the proposed changes?</HD>

          <P>DOE has sought input from a number of different sources. First, DOE issued an internal memorandum on December 7, 2009, soliciting suggestions for new categorical exclusions or revisions from DOE Program and Field Offices, including DOE's network of NEPA Compliance Officers. Second, DOE Office of NEPA Policy and Compliance staff identified additional candidates for new or expanded categorical exclusions by reviewing the archive of DOE EAs that led to findings of no significant impact (FONSIs), researched the existing categorical exclusions established by approximately 50 Federal agencies, and reviewed existing DOE categorical exclusions to identify potential new categorical exclusions or revisions. Third, on December 29, 2009, DOE published a Request for Information in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(74 FR 68720) seeking suggestions from interested parties. Eleven entities responded to the Request for Information: Endicott Biofuels, LLC; Golder Associates, Inc.; INFORM (Information Network for Responsible Mining); Johnson Controls, Inc.; Nuclear Watch New Mexico; Presco Energy, LLC; Sierra Geothermal Power Corp.; Solar Energy Industries Association; State of Oregon's Department of Energy; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and a contractor for DOE's Golden Field Office. The Request for Information and these comments are available at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>The comments included proposals for new categorical exclusions and suggested revisions to limit or expand existing categorical exclusions or other related provisions. DOE addresses these comments in its discussion of specific classes of actions in Section IV. Comments of a more general nature that were not associated with a particular provision are addressed below in Section V.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">How did DOE develop the proposed changes?</HD>

          <P>As described above, DOE reviewed and evaluated each of the proposed revisions, reviewed past DOE NEPA analyses and other agencies' NEPA analyses and categorical exclusions, and drafted proposed categorical exclusions and revisions. DOE created a Technical Support Document that presents proposed changes and information that supplements the Preamble discussion of the supporting basis for the changes. (<E T="03">See http://www.regulations.gov,</E>Docket ID: DOE-HQ-2010-0002.) The proposed changes were developed in consultation with CEQ (<E T="03">see</E>40 CFR 1507.3), and are now, through this notice of proposed rulemaking, published for public review and comment. Instructions for how to provide comments are provided in Section III. DOE is also scheduling a public hearing to accept comments on the proposed rule. Details regarding the public hearing are provided in the<E T="02">DATES</E>and<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section and in Section III.B below. DOE will review the comments received during the public comment period, including those presented at the public hearing, and revise its proposal as appropriate. The final rule with DOE responses to comments would then be published in the<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">What kinds of changes does DOE propose?</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to amend 10 CFR part 1021, subparts C and D. The majority of changes are proposed for the categorical exclusion provisions at 10 CFR part 1021, subpart D, appendices A and B, with a small number of related changes proposed for other provisions within subparts C and D.</P>

          <P>DOE proposes to add 20 new categorical exclusions. These categorical exclusions (in the order in which they appear in appendix B) address: Stormwater runoff control; lead-based paint removal; recycling stations; determinations of excess real property; small-scale educational facilities; small-scale indoor research and development projects using nanoscale materials; research activities in salt water and freshwater environments; experimental wells for injection of small quantities of carbon dioxide; combined heat and power or cogeneration systems; small-scale renewable energy research and development and pilot projects; solar photovoltaic systems; solar thermal systems; wind turbines; ground source heat pumps; biomass power plants; methane gas recovery and utilization systems; alternative fuel vehicle fueling stations; electric vehicle charging<PRTPAGE P="216"/>stations; drop-in hydroelectric systems; and small-scale renewable energy research and development and pilot projects in salt water and freshwater environments. DOE proposes to remove two categorical exclusion categories, one EA category, and two EIS categories.</P>
          <P>DOE also proposes to modify many of the existing categorical exclusions. These revisions include substantive changes, as well as changes to reflect current regulatory or statutory references and requirements, and punctuation and grammatical changes to improve readability, clarity, and internal consistency. (By “substantive” changes DOE means a change that is more than a clarifying or consistency change; this term includes changes that alter the scope or meaning of a provision or that result in the addition or deletion of a provision.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">What would result from DOE's proposed changes?</HD>
          <P>The proposed changes would better align DOE's categorical exclusions with its current activities and its experience and bring the provisions up-to-date with current technology and regulatory requirements. The changes would also facilitate compliance with NEPA by providing for more efficient review of actions (helping the Department meet the goals set forth by Congress, for example, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005), and allowing the Department to focus its resources on proposed actions that have the potential for significant environmental impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Invitation To Comment</HD>
          <P>DOE invites interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments on the proposed rule and on the supporting information for proposed changes set forth in the Preamble and the Technical Support Document. Comments would be particularly useful to DOE if those comments: (1) Provide information to support or oppose a proposed change (for example, describing experience with similar actions that did or did not have significant environmental impacts or providing references to such experience); (2) justify increased or lessened limitations on the application of a categorical exclusion; or (3) explain recommended changes in addition to those that DOE proposes and provide the rationale for such additional changes. As appropriate, comments should refer to the specific section of the proposed rule to which the comment applies, identify a comment as a general comment, or identify a comment as a new proposal.</P>
          <P>DOE will consider all timely comments received in response to this notice of proposed rulemaking, whether presented orally at the public hearing or written and submitted electronically or by mail.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Written Comments</HD>
          <P>Comments may be submitted by one of the methods in the<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>section of this proposed rule. Comments received will be included in the administrative record and will be made available online at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov,</E>including any personal information provided, unless the comment includes information specifically identified as Confidential Business Information (CBI) or other information whose disclosure is restricted by statute. Information that you consider to be CBI or otherwise protected should be submitted by mail, not through<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>If you submit information that you believe to be exempt by law from public disclosure, you should mail one complete copy, as well as one copy from which the information claimed to be exempt by law from public disclosure has been redacted. Please include written justification as to why the redacted information is exempt from disclosure. DOE is responsible for the final determination with regard to disclosure or nondisclosure of the information and for treating it accordingly under the DOE Freedom of Information Act regulations at 10 CFR 1004.11.</P>
          <P>The<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>Web site is an “anonymous access” system, which means DOE will not know your contact information unless you provide it. If you choose not to provide contact information and DOE cannot read your comment due to technical difficulties, DOE may not be able to consider your comment. Electronic files should avoid the use of special characters and any form of encryption, and be free of any defects or viruses.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Public Hearing</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Attendance</HD>

          <P>The time, date, and location of the public hearing are listed in the<E T="02">DATES</E>and<E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>sections at the beginning of this proposed rule. Persons wishing to attend the public hearing must present government-issued identification and pass through security screening upon entering the building. Foreign nationals are subject to advance security screening procedures. Any foreign national wishing to participate or attend the public hearing should advise DOE promptly in order to initiate the necessary procedures as soon as possible; see<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT,</E>above.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Registering To Speak</HD>

          <P>Any person who has an interest in the topics addressed in this proposed rule may speak at the public hearing, either as an individual or as a representative of a group or organization of interested persons. Persons wishing to speak should register in advance, as described in<E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>. After registered speakers have made their presentations, other persons may speak to the extent that time allows.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Conduct of Public Hearing</HD>
          <P>DOE will designate an official or facilitator to preside at the public hearing. The public hearing will be informal and not a judicial or evidentiary-type hearing. DOE reserves the right to schedule the order of speakers and to establish the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. To ensure that all persons wishing to make a presentation can be heard, DOE may limit each presentation to 10 minutes or less. The presiding official or facilitator will announce any further procedural rules needed for the proper conduct of the public hearing. After the public hearing, interested persons may submit further comments until the end of the comment period.</P>
          <P>A transcript of the hearing will be made and posted at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment</HD>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments and views of interested parties on several topics. As discussed in more detail in Section IV.B below, DOE seeks comments on its use of the phrases “including, but not limited to,” and “such as” to introduce lists of examples. Unless otherwise specified, DOE's lists of examples are not intended to be exhaustive of all possible actions that fit within a categorical exclusion. DOE also seeks comments on its use of the phrase “would not have the potential to cause significant impacts” (or a similar construct) in lieu of the use of terms such as “adverse” or “substantial” as modifiers for potential impacts. DOE believes that the proposed phrase more accurately reflects NEPA and the CEQ NEPA regulations.</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments and views of interested parties on the proposals relating to the following classes of actions:</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Description of Proposed Changes</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Overview</HD>
          <P>This section describes and explains the proposed amendments to the existing DOE NEPA regulations at 10 CFR part 1021, subparts C and D.</P>
          <P>In subpart C, Implementing Procedures, the proposed amendments are minor technical changes. Specifically, to correct internal references, DOE proposes changes to three sections in subpart C: (1) 10 CFR 1021.311—Notice of intent and scoping; (2) 10 CFR 1021.322—Findings of no significant impact; and (3) 10 CFR 1021.331—Mitigation action plans. These proposed minor technical changes to subpart C are not discussed further below.</P>
          <P>In subpart D, DOE proposes extensive substantive and clarifying changes. Recurring proposals for subpart D are described in Section IV.B and then unique proposed changes to subpart D are described in Sections IV.C through IV.G. Support for the proposed revisions is summarized below, and more information regarding the supporting basis for certain provisions is provided in the Technical Support Document.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is subpart D of the DOE NEPA regulations?</HD>
          <P>DOE's NEPA regulations at 10 CFR part 1021 include subpart D, which lists classes of actions and the typical level of NEPA review required for those classes of actions. Subpart D appendices A and B describe DOE's categorical exclusions. Appendix C describes classes of actions that normally require preparation of an EA, but not necessarily an EIS, and appendix D describes classes of actions that normally require preparation of an EIS.</P>
          <P>Listing a class of actions in these appendices does not constitute a conclusive determination regarding the appropriate level of NEPA review for a proposed action. Rather, the listing creates an initial assumption that the defined level of review is appropriate for the listed actions. As indicated in the existing 10 CFR 1021.400(c) and (d), this assumption does not apply when there are extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the action.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">What types of changes does DOE propose to subpart D?</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to make several types of changes to its subpart D regulations: these revisions include substantive changes, as well as changes to reflect current regulatory or statutory references and requirements, and punctuation and grammatical changes to improve readability, clarity, and internal consistency. A proposed change does not imply that any previous application of these regulations was inappropriate.<E T="03">See</E>10 CFR 1021.400(b).</P>
          <P>DOE also proposes to delete the tables of contents for the classes of actions in subpart D, and instead to precede each section or paragraph with a short title. These short titles are included merely to guide the reader and do not have any regulatory effect.</P>

          <P>Some of the proposed changes apply multiple times throughout the provisions; others are made in the context of a specific provision. Section IV.B of this proposed rule contains an explanation of proposals that recur, that is, that affect more than one class of actions, instead of duplicating the explanation for multiple individual classes of actions. Descriptions of specific individual proposed changes and support for such changes begin with Section IV.C. With respect to certain proposed changes, a more detailed explanation of the supporting basis is provided in the Technical Support Document. (The Technical Support Document and the “redline/strikeout” markup of DOE's existing regulations that show the proposed changes are available at<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E>.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Recurring Proposals, Technology Updates, and Minor Changes</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes certain changes to its regulations that recur throughout subpart D. Seven recurring proposals are described below and are followed by a listing of the existing provisions where the recurring proposals occur. Discussion of these recurring proposals is not repeated in the discussion of classes of actions in Section IV below.</P>
          <P>DOE also proposes to modify certain technology-specific vocabulary to reflect current usage, updates to references, and minor changes to punctuation and grammar to improve internal consistency. For example, to update technology-specific vocabulary, DOE proposes to change “electric powerlines” to “electric transmission lines” in several categorical exclusions. DOE also proposes to update references, as in categorical exclusion B3.12, which would reference the latest edition of a Centers for Disease Control manual. DOE is proposing to correct typographical errors (for example, changing “with” to “within” in categorical exclusion B1.13). Also, for certain classes of actions, DOE is proposing the addition of cross-references to related classes of actions. For example, DOE is proposing to add a cross-reference to the proposed new categorical exclusion B1.33 into the existing categorical exclusion B1.6.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.1. Adjacent/Contiguous/Nearby</HD>

          <P>To clarify use of terms reflecting proximity, and to promote consistency in its categorical exclusions, DOE is proposing to delete the word “adjacent” from its categorical exclusions and use “contiguous” and “nearby,” as appropriate. DOE proposes to use the word “contiguous,” where the intended application is “touching along a boundary or at a point” or “being in actual contact.” In contrast, DOE is proposing to use the word “nearby,” where the intended application is “not distant” or “in proximity, but not necessarily touching.” In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B1.31, B2.1, B4.7, B5.8, B5.12.<PRTPAGE P="218"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.2. Including, But Not Limited to/Including/Such as</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to use the phrases “including, but not limited to,” “including,” and “such as” to introduce lists of examples. DOE considers the phrases to be synonymous. Unless otherwise specified, DOE's lists of examples are not intended to be exhaustive of all possible actions that fit within a class of actions. DOE proposes generally to use “including, but not limited to,” the first time that examples are introduced in a provision and “such as” for any needed clarification of the examples. In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: 1021.410(b)(2), A1, A6, A9, A12, B(4), B1.3, B1.5, B1.9, B1.10, B1.11, B1.12, B1.13, B1.15, B1.16, B1.17, B1.20, B1.21, B1.24, B1.27, B1.29, B1.31, B1.32, B2.4, B2.5, B3.1, B3.4, B3.6, B3.7, B3.8, B3.9, B3.10, B3.11, B3.12, B3.13, B4.4, B4.6, B4.7, B4.9, B4.10, B4.11, B5.1, B5.2, B5.3, B5.4, B5.5, B5.6, B5.12, B6.1, B6.2, B6.3, B6.4, B7.2, C8, C16.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.3. In Accordance With Applicable Requirements</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to use the phrase “in accordance with applicable requirements” in several of its categorical exclusions for emphasis. DOE recognizes that all actions must be conducted in accordance with all applicable requirements. However, with certain categorical exclusions, DOE finds it appropriate to refer specifically to this requirement, and, further, in some cases also to provide one or more examples of applicable requirements. By referring to a specific requirement, DOE does not imply that the requirement is relevant to all actions to which the categorical exclusion may apply, or that the referenced requirement is the only one that applies to a proposed action. DOE's proposed wording is intended to allow for the evolution of the requirements over time. In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B1.2, B1.3, B1.9, B1.16, B1.17, B1.29, B2.5, B3.8, B3.12, B5.4, B5.6, B6.1, B7.2.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.4. Would Not Have the Potential To Cause Significant Impacts</HD>

          <P>Appendices A and B contain a number of provisions that contain the word “adverse,” or the use of “any” or “no” as descriptors of, or surrogates for, impacts. Through this proposed rulemaking, DOE proposes to replace these terms with “would not have the potential to cause significant impacts” or a similar construct (for example, describing a physical change that serves as a surrogate for impacts, such as in categorical exclusions B1.18, B3.4, B3.9, and B5.2). By the proposed changes, DOE's implementing regulations are now clearly aligned with the regulatory standard in NEPA.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 1508.4. Additionally, by this proposed change, DOE seeks to clarify the affected provisions and to facilitate consistent application.<E T="03">See also</E>40 CFR 1508.27 (addressing the meaning of “significantly” as used in NEPA).</P>
          <P>DOE's review of the existing provisions demonstrated the need for clarification and consistency. For example, the existing categorical exclusion B3.8 requires that the action “would not result in any permanent change to the ecosystem.” A literal reading of this categorical exclusion would bar its use if there were any permanent change to the ecosystem, even a change that would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. DOE acknowledges that this is not what NEPA requires and thus DOE proposes to rephrase the categorical exclusion to incorporate the appropriate NEPA standard, phrased as “would not have the potential to cause significant impacts on the ecosystem.” In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B(4), B1.5, B1.11, B1.18, B1.24, B1.31, B2.3, B3.1, B3.3, B3.8, B3.9, B4.6, B5.1, B5.2, B5.12, C8.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.5. On DOE Sites/Onsite/Employee</HD>

          <P>In recent years, DOE's proposed actions have included more applicant proposals, including those for DOE loan guarantees, grants, cooperative agreements, and other forms of financial assistance, particularly for programs created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In an applicant situation, DOE's proposed action normally would not be located on a DOE site, but rather on private property or land administered by other agencies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Bureau of Land Management). In recognition of DOE's recently expanded activities, DOE is proposing, where appropriate, to delete references to “DOE site,” “onsite,” or “employee” from its classes of actions. For example, DOE is proposing to amend existing categorical exclusion B1.13, Pathways, short access roads, and rail lines, by deleting “onsite” and instead inserting the condition that the construction, acquisition, and relocation of these linear features be “consistent with applicable right-of-way conditions and approved land use or transportation improvement plans.” The significance of environmental impacts resulting from a class of actions does not depend on whether they occur at DOE sites.</P>
          <P>In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B1.13, B1.15, B1.29, B1.32, B3.1, B6.10, C7, D7.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.6. Previously Disturbed or Developed Area</HD>

          <P>In DOE's experience, the potential for certain types of actions to have significant impacts on the human environment is generally avoided when that action takes place within a previously disturbed or developed area,<E T="03">i.e.,</E>land that has been changed such that the former state of the area and its functioning ecological processes have been altered. Thus, DOE includes a requirement in several of its proposed provisions that actions be located within previously disturbed or developed areas. In other instances, the existing provision contains a similar requirement, and DOE proposes to replace the existing language with the phrase “previously disturbed or developed area” for purposes of internal consistency. In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B1.31, B2.1, B3.6, B3.10, B3.12, B4.6, B4.7, B4.8, B4.12, B5.1, B5.5, B5.8, B6.10, C4, C11.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B.7. Small/Small-Scale/Minor/Negligible/Short/Short-Term</HD>

          <P>DOE uses adjectives (such as “small,” “small-scale,” “minor,” “negligible,” “short,” and “short-term”) as limitations in a variety of its existing and proposed provisions and recognizes that these descriptors are subjective. In general, DOE did not and does not propose to define these terms, and DOE would apply a reasonable interpretation to such terms within the context of individual proposals. The CEQ regulations state that “significantly,” as used in NEPA, requires consideration of context and intensity.<E T="03">See</E>40 CFR 1508.27. Likewise, consideration of context and intensity is useful when interpreting descriptors such as small, small-scale, minor, short, and short-term, in making categorical exclusion determinations for proposals. (DOE proposes to discontinue the use of the word “negligible.”)</P>

          <P>For example, in considering whether the use of 5-10 acres of land is “small”<PRTPAGE P="219"/>for a particular proposal, it is reasonable to conclude that 5-10 acres of land at a large DOE site would likely be considered “small,” but 5-10 acres of land might not be considered “small” in an urban environment. In some instances, however, the Department has quantified these descriptors because the size is more directly linked to impacts. For example, DOE categorizes a “small” area for outdoor ecological and other environmental research as generally less than 5 acres in its existing categorical exclusion B3.8. Additionally, DOE defines “small” water treatment facilities as those that have a total capacity of less than 250,000 gallons/day in existing categorical exclusion B1.26.</P>
          <P>In order to facilitate consistent understanding and application of this concept, DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B1.2, B1.13, B1.15, B3.6, B3.8, B4.13, B5.1, B5.4, B5.7, C8.</P>

          <P>DOE proposes to clarify four requirements in 10 CFR 1021.410. First, DOE proposes to remove the reference to Section 102(2)(E) of NEPA to clarify that DOE's consideration of unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources is independent of the need to evaluate alternatives in an EA as indicated in Section 102(2)(E) of NEPA.</P>
          <P>Second, in 10 CFR 1021.410(b)(3), DOE proposes to refer explicitly to the requirement that a categorically excludable project has not been segmented. DOE also proposes to change its references to the CEQ regulations to clarify consideration of potential cumulative impacts (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)), and to clarify that its references to 40 CFR 1506.1 and 10 CFR 1021.211 concern limitations on actions during EIS preparation.</P>
          <P>Third, DOE proposes to add site preparation and purchase and installation of equipment to 10 CFR 1021.410(d) as examples of activities foreseeably necessary to implement proposals that are encompassed within the class of actions.</P>

          <P>Fourth, DOE proposes to codify its policy to document and post online appendix B categorical exclusion determinations at 10 CFR 1021.410(e), consistent with the policy established by the Deputy Secretary of Energy's<E T="03">Memorandum to Departmental Elements on NEPA Process Transparency and Openness</E>, October 2, 2009.</P>

          <P>To increase transparency of DOE's NEPA processes, DOE proposes to delete this categorical exclusion and to incorporate its key components within B1.24, which also addresses property transfers, so that any categorically excluded property transfers are documented and made available to the public.

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Proposed Changes to Appendix B</HD>

          <P>For an explanation of recurring proposals applicable to the appendix B categorical exclusions, please<E T="03">see</E>Section IV.B, Recurring Proposals, above, where these proposed revisions are discussed and the particular categorical exclusions affected are listed. The short titles listed below for particular categorical exclusions reflect DOE's proposed titles.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Integral Elements of the Classes of Actions in Appendix B</HD>
          <P>In appendix B(4), DOE proposes to clarify its use of “environmentally sensitive resource,” defining it as “typically a resource that has been identified as needing protection through Executive Order, statute, or regulation by Federal, State, or local government, or a Federally recognized Indian Tribe.” This definition is not intended to, and does not, grant, expand, create, or diminish any legally enforceable rights, benefits, or responsibilities, substantive or procedural, not otherwise granted or created under existing law. Nor shall this language be construed to alter, amend, repeal, interpret, or modify Tribal sovereignty, any treaty rights of any Indian Tribes, or to preempt, modify, or limit the exercise of any such rights.</P>
          <P>In appendix B(4)(i), DOE proposes to add “Federally recognized Indian Tribe” to its list of entities that designate property as historically, archeologically, or architecturally significant. DOE also proposes to redefine other environmentally sensitive properties as “determined to be eligible” for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (rather than the phrase “eligible for listing,” which is used in the existing provision, but is not the proper characterization of an official listing). In appendix B(4)(iii), DOE proposes to apply the same definition of floodplains and wetlands in its NEPA regulations as that used in DOE's floodplain and wetland environmental review regulations (10 CFR part 1022.4). In appendix B(4)(iv), DOE proposes to supplement the list of areas having special designation with additional examples (national monuments and scenic areas). In appendix B(4)(v), DOE proposes changes to the prime agricultural lands listing to conform to the terminology of the applicable regulation (7 CFR 658.2(a), “Farmland Protection Policy Act: Definitions”).</P>

          <P>In response to the Department's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor addressed DOE's list of “environmentally sensitive resources” in appendix B(4). First, the commentor indicated that DOE must recognize State and Tribal protected or candidate species and habitat as equal to Federally designated or considered species and<PRTPAGE P="220"/>habitats. Currently, appendix B(4)(ii) includes consideration of State-listed endangered and threatened species and their habitats, and DOE is proposing to add Federally-protected marine mammals and Essential Fish Habitat to the list of environmentally sensitive resources. DOE is not proposing to include Tribal protected or candidate species and habitat because it is DOE's understanding that Tribes do not have the authority to designate species or habitat for protection outside of Tribal lands.</P>
          <P>Second, the commentor stated that “groundwater and aquifers are State, not Federal resources” and indicated that DOE's regulations must protect and preserve all aquifers, and not just sole-source aquifers. The commentor further stated that adverse impacts to rivers, lakes, and bays, among other bodies of water, should not be allowed “unless they are specifically covered by a State and/or Tribal discharge permit under appropriate authority.” DOE is not proposing a change to the existing appendix B(4)(vi), which lists “special sources of water (such as sole source aquifers, wellhead protection areas, and other water sources that are vital in a region)” in its list of environmentally sensitive resources, because those resources are listed as examples and are not the only water sources to be considered in applying a categorical exclusion. Further, the existing appendix B(4) includes States and Federally recognized Tribes as entities with jurisdiction to identify water sources needing protection.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Categorical Exclusions Applicable to Facility Operation (B1)</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.1Changing Rates and Prices</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to change this categorical exclusion to encompass the setting of “prices” as well as “rates” (prices apply to products, and rates apply to services) and to consider price and rate changes instead of only increases. DOE proposes to change the measure of inflation specified in this categorical exclusion from the Gross National Product fixed weight price index, which the Department of Commerce no longer publishes, to the implicit price deflator for Gross Domestic Product. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.2Training Exercises and Simulations</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to provide additional examples of training actions (namely, small-scale and short-duration force-on-force exercises, and decontamination and spill cleanup training), and has added the condition that all training exercises and simulations be conducted under appropriately controlled conditions and in accordance with applicable requirements. The term “force-on-force” as used in this categorical exclusion refers to activities such as assault and defensive team exercises conducted by security forces or military units, often on parcels of DOE property not in use. Exercises that test the ability of security forces to defend a facility are one common example of this type of training. DOE's experience with these types of security force and military training actions and emergency response training at its sites indicates that they fit within the class of actions. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.3Routine Maintenance</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to clarify that routine maintenance actions may occur as a result of nonroutine events (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>severe weather, such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes, and wildfires) by adding a sentence to that effect in its description of routine maintenance. Normally, maintenance following a nonroutine event would qualify as routine maintenance; however, for a nonroutine event, the potential for extraordinary circumstances is higher (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>increased exposure to pesticides due to extreme runoff).</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to clarify the scope of the categorical exclusion by providing additional examples of activities. Specifically, DOE is proposing to clarify that replacement is included in the categorical exclusion's scope under items (a), (c), and (e), as well as the existing example of repair; to add “lighting” to those items that can be repaired or replaced (item (e)); to add “scraping and grading of unpaved surfaces” to the example of road and parking area resurfacing (item (j)); and to add the additional example of “removal of debris” under item (p). DOE's experience with these activities has demonstrated that they properly fit within this class of actions.</P>
          <P>In response to the Department's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor stated that use of pesticides for outdoor or aquatic use should not be the subject of a categorical exclusion; instead an EA should be prepared. The commentor expressed a specific concern about the possibility for environmental impacts beyond the intended application. In existing categorical exclusion B1.3, DOE has described routine maintenance activities including localized vegetation and pest control. DOE now proposes to clarify that any routine maintenance activities would be conducted in a manner in accordance with applicable requirements. In the case of pesticides and other chemicals, for example, the proposed change would provide that the application would be in accordance with the registered and approved uses established by appropriate authorities to minimize the possibility of environmental impacts beyond the product's intended application.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.5Existing Steam Plants and Cooling Water Systems</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to delete the words “within an existing building or structure,” so as to include modifications to ponds, which may be outdoor components of cooling water systems. This proposed expansion of the scope of this categorical exclusion would address the need for improvements to an entire cooling water system, rather than only those parts of a system associated with structures. Based on DOE experience, minor improvements would not have the potential to cause significant impacts, provided the three limitations placed on the scale and type of improvements listed in the categorical exclusion are met.</P>
          <P>DOE also proposes to add minor improvements of existing steam plants in the scope of the categorical exclusion. DOE's experience is that these actions, when subject to the three limitations placed on the scale and type of such improvements, fit appropriately within this class of actions and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.7Electronic Equipment</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to update the existing categorical exclusion by adding examples of current technology and equipment that improve operational efficiency and stability of the nation's power grid, commonly referred to as “smart grid” technologies. Based on DOE's experience, such technology and equipment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E>electricity transmission control and monitoring devices for grid demand and response) fit within the scope of this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.9Airway Safety Markings and Painting</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to include repair and in-kind replacement of lighting within the scope of this categorical exclusion. Within the context of this categorical exclusion, in-kind replacement is defined as replacement that does not result in a significant change in the expected useful life, design capacity (for example, energy output in lumens), function, or shielding of existing<PRTPAGE P="221"/>lighting. The initial installation of such lighting would remain ineligible for categorical exclusion. In addition, DOE proposes to add wind turbines as structures similar to transmission lines and antenna structures to which the exclusion applies. DOE has determined that these proposed changes would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.11Fencing</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to clarify that the limitation in this categorical exclusion applies to fencing that would have the potential to cause significant impacts to surface water flow or wildlife populations or migration, as opposed to individual animal movements. Fencing can and probably often does affect individual movements, but such impacts on individual animals would not be considered significant unless the context and intensity of the impacts would have the potential to cause significant impacts to wildlife populations or migration.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.12Detonation or Burning of Explosives or Propellants After Testing</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to delete the restriction that explosives or propellants must have failed in outdoor tests and thus to expand the categorical exclusion to include explosives or propellants that failed in indoor tests. Whether the explosives or propellants were tested indoors or outdoors, the outdoor detonation or burning of those explosives or propellants would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. The phrase “otherwise not consumed in testing” refers to excess or residual explosive or propellant materials that remain after a test is completed. DOE also proposes to specify one type of permit under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act that could be applicable.</P>
          <P>In response to DOE's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor requested that DOE specify the amount, types, and methods allowed for the activities included in this categorical exclusion. DOE has determined that the limits contained in this categorical exclusion do not require quantification and is not proposing any changes to the categorical exclusion in response to this comment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.13Pathways, Short Access Roads, and Rail Lines</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to expand the scope of the categorical exclusion to include more projects related to transportation, recreation, and fitness (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>pedestrian walkways and trails, bicycle paths, and small outdoor fitness areas). Other Federal agencies that have categorical exclusions for comparable projects are the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security, and the experience of these agencies supports DOE's proposed expansion of this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <P>DOE also proposes to include a condition in the categorical exclusion that the actions be consistent with existing rights-of-way and approved land use or transportation improvement plans. In addition, DOE proposes to replace “railroads” with the term “rail lines,” adding branch or spur lines as examples. DOE's experience is that the construction of rail access to or within an existing site has generally occurred at a scale that is better characterized by these small-scale activities—branch line (a secondary rail line which may branch off a main line) and spur (a rail track on which cars are left for loading, unloading, or rail car storage).</P>

          <P>In response to the DOE's December 2009 Request for Information, a commentor stated that road construction or expansion should not be the subject of a categorical exclusion. Further, the commentor expressed a concern about the potential for damage to “high quality, high priority habitat” as a result of constructing and operating roads and that use of such a categorical exclusion would limit or circumvent consideration of appropriate mitigation for habitat disturbance or loss. As outlined above, DOE's proposed amendments to categorical exclusion B1.13 require the construction, acquisition, and relocation of short access roads and rail lines to be consistent with applicable right-of-way conditions and approved land use or transportation improvement plans. Furthermore, consideration of the integral elements in applying this categorical exclusion addresses the possibility of damage to “high quality, high priority habitat” because, among other things, one of the “environmentally sensitive resources” to consider in those integral elements is habitat for Federally or State-listed species. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.15Support Buildings</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to expand the list of examples of support buildings and support structures to include those for “small-scale fabrication (such as machine shop activities and modular buildings), assembly, and testing of non-nuclear equipment or components.” Such structures are comparable to, or smaller in scale than, other structures given as examples in the categorical exclusion, and DOE's experience at DOE sites is that siting, construction, and operation of these activities normally fit within the class of actions. Also, DOE proposes to further clarify the scope of the categorical exclusion by specifying that it excludes facilities for nuclear weapon activities.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.19Microwave, Meteorological, and Radio Towers</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to add “modification,” “abandonment,” and “removal” to the list of activities included in this class of actions in order to describe the complete life cycle of categorically excluded towers. In DOE's experience, modification, abandonment, and removal of these towers and associated facilities, when subject to the restrictions in this categorical exclusion, would have fewer impacts than construction and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to include meteorological towers as an additional example of applicable facilities within this categorical exclusion because DOE has determined that the environmental impacts resulting from siting, construction, modification, operation, abandonment, and removal of meteorological towers would be similar to the impacts from these activities relating to microwave and radio towers already contained in the scope of the existing categorical exclusion.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to clarify the restriction in the existing categorical exclusion, by replacing “great visual value” with a more objective criteria of “governmentally designated scenic area” and cross-referencing to the relevant integral element (appendix B(4)(iv)).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.20Protection of Cultural Resources, Fish and Wildlife Habitat</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to add to the scope of this categorical exclusion by referencing activities taken to protect cultural resources and by including examples of those activities (fencing, labeling, or flagging). DOE's Power Marketing Administrations often engage in such activities for cultural and wildlife protection purposes, and these activities would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. DOE also proposes to include a condition in the categorical exclusion that the activities would be conducted in accordance with an existing natural or cultural resource plan, if any.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.23Demolition and Disposal of Buildings</HD>

          <P>In response to DOE's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor questioned whether there should be a<PRTPAGE P="222"/>size limitation for the activities under this categorical exclusion. Further, the commentor asked how DOE takes into consideration possible contamination when applying this categorical exclusion. In response to these comments, DOE proposes to modify this categorical exclusion by adding a limitation that these activities could be categorically excluded only if there would be no potential for release of substances at a level, or in a form, that could pose a threat to public health or the environment.</P>
          <P>The application of this categorical exclusion is intended to be based on existing data and knowledge about historical uses of the area, including chemical and other processes employed. DOE has extensive experience (former Rocky Flats Site, Hanford Site, Idaho National Laboratory, and other sites) in determining the potential for release of harmful substances from activities through modeling and safety basis authorization documentation. Potential hazards are considered before taking action (for example, demolition actions), and monitoring is conducted, as appropriate, to verify that there are no harmful releases of radiological or hazardous materials. Potential for releases can reliably be determined through site inventories, the use of well-established release models, and established best practices.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.24Property Transfers</HD>
          <P>As discussed under categorical exclusion A7 (above), DOE proposes to delete A7 and incorporate its key components, including transfers of personal property (equipment and materials), within B1.24. By doing this, DOE makes categorical exclusion determinations for property transfers subject to documentation and online posting. DOE proposes to remove the reference to “uncontaminated” as unnecessary given the incorporation of the substance of this limitation in the revised categorical exclusion.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to delete the phrases “there would not be any lessening in quality or increases in volumes, concentrations, or discharge rates, of wastes, air emissions, or water effluents” and “environmental impacts would generally be similar to those before the transfer” as potentially inconsistent. DOE proposes to replace these phrases with “there would be no potential for release of substances at a level, or in a form, that could pose a threat to public health or the environment” and “would not have the potential to cause a significant change in impacts from the transfer.” Such terminology will, in DOE's experience, ensure that any property transfers under this categorical exclusion would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <P>In response to DOE's December 2009 Request for Information, a commentor expressed concern that DOE, in making land transfer decisions under existing categorical exclusion A7, would be “circumventing local authority” and “normal land use planning and zoning processes.” The potential applicability of such authority and processes to a potential land transfer would be addressed on a case-by-case basis.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.25Property Transfers for Cultural Resources Protection, Habitat Preservation, and Wildlife Management</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to include in B1.25 actions undertaken to protect cultural resources. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations often engage in property transfers for cultural protection purposes. Based on this experience, DOE finds property transfers intended for protecting cultural resources normally would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. Further, DOE proposes to remove the limitation that only associated buildings supporting certain purposes are to be transferred with property under this categorical exclusion, because the existing purpose of structures present on a property to be transferred for wildlife or cultural resource purposes is unrelated to environmental impacts associated with such transfer.</P>
          <P>Also, for the reasons discussed for categorical exclusion B1.24, above, DOE proposes to eliminate the references to “uncontaminated,” but include a limitation on actions subject to categorical exclusion B1.25, that there would be no potential for release of a substance at a level or in a form, that could pose a threat to public health or the environment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.29Disposal Facilities for Construction and Demolition Waste</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to add “expansion” and “modification” to the list of activities included in this categorical exclusion in order to include all aspects of the life cycle of the disposal facilities. In DOE's experience, expansion and modification actions, when subject to the limitations expressed in this categorical exclusion, would have fewer impacts than construction, and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.30Transfer Actions</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to modify this categorical exclusion (based on its experience transferring materials and equipment) to remove the condition that the amounts of materials, equipment, or waste being transferred must be “small and incidental” to the amount of such material at the receiving site. Instead, DOE proposes to add a condition that the receiving site has existing storage capacity and management capability for the material.</P>
          <P>In addition, DOE proposes to limit use of the categorical exclusion to, as appropriate, facilities and operations that are already permitted, licensed, and approved. That is, this proposed categorical exclusion would not apply to circumstances where the receiving site requires a permit or license amendment or variance from its existing approvals in order to receive or manage the materials, and it also would not apply to circumstances where the receiving facilities are not yet completed and operational.</P>

          <P>DOE has decades of experience transporting materials, including various types of radioactive materials and waste, and has completed NEPA reviews of such transportation under many different scenarios. DOE NEPA reviews of such transfers consistently show that these actions would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. Nevertheless, DOE will continue to analyze transportation impacts in EAs and EISs where the scope of the proposed action presents the potential for significant impacts or where the proposed action fails to meet the conditions contained in this categorical exclusion. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.31Installation or Relocation of Machinery and Equipment</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes several changes to this categorical exclusion. DOE proposes to add “installation” to the list of actions, which is now limited to the “relocation” of machinery and equipment; explicitly include “operation” of installed or relocated machinery and equipment; add “manufacturing machinery” in the list of examples of machinery and equipment; and clarify that the scope of the categorical exclusion includes modifications to an existing building, within or contiguous to a previously disturbed or developed area, provided that the modifications do not appreciably increase the footprint or height of the existing building or have the potential to cause significant changes to the type and magnitude of environmental impacts. DOE also proposes to delete the restriction that uses of the installed or relocated equipment be similar to their former uses, because it is duplicative of the limitation that the actions be consistent with the general missions of the receiving structure. DOE has determined<PRTPAGE P="223"/>that these proposed changes would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>

          <P>In response to DOE's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor suggested that DOE categorically exclude projects (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>residential, commercial, and industrial) that involve retrofitting or retooling of existing structures, provided that the projects do not include new construction, disturb previously undisturbed areas, or require new or significantly modified environmental permits. Further, the commentor explained that such a categorical exclusion would help facilitate alternative energy manufacturing projects (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>batteries, solar equipment, and wind turbines) that are proposed to be located in existing manufacturing/industrial facilities and complexes. As described above, DOE has proposed several changes to this categorical exclusion that address these comments.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.32Traffic Flow Adjustments</HD>

          <P>Because DOE proposes to broaden the scope of this categorical exclusion to include actions off DOE sites (<E T="03">see</E>Recurring Proposals, Section IV.B), DOE proposes to require that the activities in this categorical exclusion occur within an existing right-of-way and be consistent with approved land use or transportation improvement plans. A “traffic flow adjustment” is a change to the flow of traffic on an existing street or road. Statewide and Metropolitan Transportation Planning processes are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (23 CFR part 450, subparts B and C, respectively) and result in approved, legally-binding, multiyear plans that stipulate transportation actions that may be carried out in a given area and over a given length of time.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.33Stormwater Runoff Control</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for stormwater runoff control practices that reduce stormwater runoff and maintain natural hydrology. The actions included in the proposed categorical exclusion are found in Environmental Protection Agency's Guidance No. EPA 841-B-09-001, Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for Federal Projects under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (December 2009). Based on the experience of Federal agencies, the opinions of subject matter experts, and private sector experience developing and deploying stormwater runoff control and low impact development practices, the types of actions included in this categorical exclusion are, in most cases, mitigation or best management practices commonly employed to protect surface water quality and to reduce erosion associated with runoff. DOE has concluded that such activities would not have the potential to cause significant environmental impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.34Lead-Based Paint</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for the containment, removal, and disposal of lead-based paint. This proposed categorical exclusion is based on laws and regulations governing such activities for buildings and other structures. Use of the proposed categorical exclusion would require adherence to applicable laws and regulations. Further, the creation of this categorical exclusion is supported by existing lead paint removal categorical exclusions from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army. DOE has determined that such paint removal actions would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.35Drop-Off, Collection and Transfer Facilities for Recyclable Materials</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for the siting, construction, modification, and operation of a recycling or compostable material drop-off, collection, and transfer station on or contiguous to developed or previously disturbed land and in an area where such a facility would be consistent with existing zoning requirements. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service have existing categorical exclusions for similar facilities. Specifically, Homeland Security has a categorical exclusion for the recycling of non-hazardous materials from routine/operational activities, and the Rural Utilities Service has a categorical exclusion for the construction of facilities for the transfer of waste that will be recycled or stored. DOE has determined that the limitations placed on recycling stations proposed in this new categorical exclusion would ensure that such actions would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B1.36Determinations of Excess Real Property</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for determinations that real property is excess to the needs of the Department. This proposed categorical exclusion includes associated reporting of such determinations to the General Services Administration and the Bureau of Land Management, as appropriate. DOE would allow the categorical exclusion of reporting of excess property, but the actual disposal of real property is not included in the scope of this proposed categorical exclusion.</P>
          <P>Other Federal agencies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>Department of Homeland Security) have existing categorical exclusions for determinations of excess real property and, based on a review of these categorical exclusions, DOE has determined that it would be conducting the same or similar activities under similar circumstances. Accordingly, DOE has concluded that its activities under this proposed categorical exclusion would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.

Actions previously encompassed by the Order are still performed by DOE and other organizations to qualify equipment for use and are still appropriate for a categorical exclusion, and DOE proposes to provide examples of such actions. Calibration of sensors and diagnostic equipment, crane and lift-gear certifications, and high efficiency particulate air (“HEPA”) filter testing and certifications, to name a few, are activities that DOE proposes to list as examples in the categorical exclusion. These types of actions have been performed routinely by DOE, other<PRTPAGE P="224"/>Federal agencies, and private entities. In DOE's experience, these activities would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B2.6Recovery of Radioactive Sealed Sources</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes changes to this categorical exclusion to better reflect the current scope of DOE's sealed source recovery activities. At the time the existing categorical exclusion was established, the focus of DOE's efforts was primarily the recovery of DOE-owned radioactive materials that had been loaned or leased, such as to universities for research, and a small number of sealed sources. DOE later established the Off-Site Source Recovery Project (OSRP) to reflect an increased emphasis on recovery of sealed sources from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Agreement State licensees in response to requests from the NRC and other Federal or State agencies. After 2001, DOE further expanded the scope of OSRP to focus on the recovery of sources with a wider variety of radioisotopes of concern from a public health, safety, or national security perspective. Due to their high activity and portability, many sealed sources could be used either individually or in aggregate in radiological dispersal devices commonly referred to as “dirty bombs.” DOE prioritizes the recovery of radioactive sealed sources based on threat reduction criteria developed in coordination with the NRC. DOE's experience with the recovery of more than 25,000 radioactive sealed sources since 1979 demonstrates that these activities are routinely conducted and do not have the potential to cause significant environmental impact.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to simplify the existing categorical exclusion to address the recovery of radioactive sealed sources and sealed source-containing devices from domestic or foreign locations provided that (1) the recovered items are transported and stored in compliant containers, and (2) the receiving site has sufficient existing storage capacity and all required licenses, permits, and approvals.</P>
          <P>These proposed changes would reflect changes in DOE's source recovery activities since the existing categorical exclusion was formulated. First, recovery activities are no longer limited to requests from NRC or other Federal or State agencies. DOE also considers requests for source recovery from foreign governments and private parties, including private parties in foreign countries. Also, DOE provides financial and technical support to third parties (principally the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors) for source recovery activities. Second, the scope of DOE activities is not limited to materials or licensees addressed in 10 CFR 51.22(14).</P>

          <P>The proposed changes also would remove the reference to certain items that are not sealed sources (such as uranium shielding material and packaged radioactive waste not exceeding 50 curies). DOE has determined that the packaging, transportation, and storage of these types of materials normally would fit within categorical exclusion B1.30, Transfer actions.

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.1Site Characterization and Environmental Monitoring</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes several changes to categorical exclusion B3.1. DOE proposes to limit the scope of this categorical exclusion to terrestrial characterization and monitoring, as DOE is proposing a new categorical exclusion for such actions in salt water and freshwater environments (categorical exclusion B3.16 below). DOE also proposes to limit categorically excluded activities to those that would not have the potential to cause significant impacts from ground disturbance. Based on a project description for seismic surveying submitted by a commentor in response to DOE's December 2009 Request for Information, and after considering the potential scale of seismic surveying projects, DOE proposes to also limit the scope of the categorical exclusion so as not to include large-scale reflection or refraction testing with regard to seismic techniques.</P>
          <P>One commentor responding to DOE's Request for Information suggested that DOE's list of categorical exclusions match all the categorical exclusions currently being used by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, particularly for geophysical surveys for exploration of geothermal resources. Another commentor suggested that DOE include a categorical exclusion for terrestrial seismic survey activities. In response to both comments, DOE notes that item (a) of the existing B3.1 categorical exclusion lists geological, geophysical, and geochemical surveying and mapping, including seismic surveying, as examples of actions in the scope of the categorical exclusion. Thus DOE determined that it was not necessary to propose new categorical exclusions in response to these comments.</P>

          <P>DOE proposes to clarify the scope of the existing categorical exclusion, however, by providing additional examples of actions that DOE's experience has demonstrated properly fit within this class of actions. In response to the suggestion above and from another commentor concerning geothermal resources, DOE proposes to include temperature gradient surveying as an example of geophysical surveying activities encompassed within item (a). DOE also proposes to add underground reservoir response testing for item (d). The potential impacts of aquifer and reservoir response testing are well-known and normally insignificant; underground reservoir response testing could help determine, for example, whether further study of a reservoir for carbon sequestration purposes is warranted. DOE also proposes to add drilling using truck or mobile-scale equipment and modification, use, and plugging of boreholes as representative examples of small-scale drilling activities under item (f). DOE experience indicates that these changes would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>

          <P>DOE proposes to modify this categorical exclusion to include actions undertaken to protect cultural resources. These types of actions (such as walking a site, visually surveying, and digging small, shallow test holes with hand tools) are similar to types of actions undertaken for wildlife protection and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.6Small-Scale Research and Development, Laboratory Operations, and Pilot Projects</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes changes to this categorical exclusion for clarity. First, DOE proposes to delete the phrase “indoor bench-scale research,” which DOE views as encompassed within “small-scale research and development,” which is more easily understood. DOE also proposes to define “demonstration actions” in the context of this categorical exclusion and the related EA class of actions C12 as “actions that are undertaken at a scale to show whether a technology would be viable on a larger scale and suitable for commercial deployment. Demonstration actions frequently follow research and development and pilot projects that are directed at establishing proof of<PRTPAGE P="225"/>concept.” This definition reflects DOE's understanding of the delineation between pilot projects and demonstration projects that would be relevant to the scope of this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.7New Terrestrial Infill Exploratory and Experimental Wells</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to modify the scope of the categorical exclusion. DOE proposes to expand the categorical exclusion by providing additional examples of resources (brine, carbon dioxide, coalbed methane, gas hydrate) for which exploratory or experimental wells may be drilled. For carbon sequestration wells, DOE proposes to list examples of possible uses, including, but not limited to, the study of saline formations, enhanced oil recovery, and enhanced coalbed methane extraction. DOE also proposes to expand the locations where the infill wells may be drilled (now only in fields with operating wells) to fields with properly abandoned wells or unminable coal seams.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to limit this categorical exclusion to the terrestrial environment and to require that characterization has verified a low potential for seismicity, subsidence, and contamination of freshwater aquifers.</P>
          <P>DOE experience with new infill exploratory and experimental (test) oil, gas, and geothermal wells continues to show that they would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. DOE experience also shows that the potential impacts of infill exploratory and test wells for substances such as brine, carbon dioxide, coalbed methane, and gas hydrate would be similar and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts under the limitations of this proposed categorical exclusion. Based on DOE's experience, the proposal to expand the scope of this categorical exclusion, subject to the proposed additional limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the proposed revisions to this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.8Outdoor Terrestrial Ecological and Environmental Research</HD>

          <P>DOE is proposing two new categorical exclusions covering small-scale research activities in salt water and freshwater environments, and those two categorical exclusions limit the types of activities and their location specifically to protect aquatic environments. (<E T="03">See</E>B3.16 for research activities in salt water and freshwater environments and B5.25 for small-scale renewable energy research and development and pilot projects in salt water and freshwater environments.) DOE is therefore proposing to clarify that the types of covered actions included in B3.8 are solely limited to terrestrial environments.</P>
          <P>DOE is also proposing to clarify that this categorical exclusion includes small-scale biomass and biofuels research. Given the current focus on the development of biomass and biofuel production and the need for proof of concept research in this area, DOE proposes to state explicitly that small test plots for energy-related biomass or biofuels research (including the use of genetically engineered plants) are within the scope of this categorical exclusion.</P>

          <P>Research using genetically engineered plants to be grown specifically for biomass production has reached the point where field tests are being performed outdoors for proof of concept purposes. At the same time, residues from biotechnology crops such as corn and soybeans are being tested as feedstocks for biofuel production. Such plants are currently regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and these existing regulatory regimes have analyzed the environmental impacts resulting from the experimental and commercial growth of these crops, so there is no need for DOE to analyze separately these impacts to show their insignificance. DOE has determined that a categorical exclusion would be appropriate for small field tests, provided that the applicant already has all the necessary authorizations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and received all necessary permissions to proceed with the trial. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.9Projects To Reduce Emissions and Waste Generation</HD>

          <P>This categorical exclusion was initially created for demonstration actions under DOE's Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program. However, after many years of experience with projects that reduce emissions and waste generation at existing fossil fuel facilities and, more recently, at alternative energy facilities, DOE is proposing modifications to the categorical exclusion for these activities regardless of whether or not they are part of DOE's Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program. Specifically, DOE is proposing to expand the scope of this categorical exclusion to include projects to reduce emissions and waste generation at alternative fuel (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>biomass) facilities, in addition to fossil fuel facilities. As a result, DOE is proposing conforming revisions throughout this categorical exclusion (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>replacing “coal” with “fuel”). Further, DOE proposes to define fuel to include “coal, oil, natural gas, hydrogen, syngas [synthesis gas], and biomass,” and specifically to exclude nuclear fuels.</P>

          <P>Based on its experience with these activities, DOE has found that projects that demonstrate ways to reduce emissions and waste generation at existing fossil or alternative fuel combustion or utilization facilities would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.) DOE also proposes to remove from categorical exclusion B3.9(a) the 20 percent limitation on test treatment of the throughput product (solid, liquid, or gas) generated at existing, fully operational fuel combustion or utilization facilities. Although test treatment on a fraction of the throughput product (sometimes referred to as “slipstream testing”) may be helpful in evaluating new treatment technologies, DOE experience shows that test treatment of the entire throughput product stream may be needed to provide an adequate demonstration of the commercial viability of technologies that could reduce emissions from existing facilities. DOE analyses and experience show that such test treatment normally would not have the potential to cause significant impacts under the limitations of this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <P>Further, DOE proposes to remove from B3.9(c) the two-year limitation on the addition or replacement of equipment for reduction or control of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, or other regulated substances at existing facilities. In DOE's experience, the potential for significant impacts of such projects does not depend on the duration of the demonstration. Moreover, two years may be too short a period of time for an adequate demonstration of equipment whose continued use is likely to be beneficial.</P>

          <P>In addition to the provisions of B3.9(c), DOE proposes explicitly to include the addition or modification of equipment for capture and control of carbon dioxide or other regulated substances, provided that adequate infrastructure is in place to manage such substances. The use of such equipment offers the potential for environmental benefits by providing needed information on the costs, operability, and reliability of capture technologies that could enable their future deployment in existing conventional coal and other fuel utilization facilities. DOE's knowledge and experience with the physical or chemical unit processes<PRTPAGE P="226"/>that could capture carbon dioxide at existing facilities show such processes would not have the potential to cause significant impacts under the conditions specified in the proposed modification of this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.10Particle Accelerators</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to modify this categorical exclusion by more clearly specifying the operating parameters for particle accelerators. This categorical exclusion currently has only one limiting parameter (primary beam energy less than approximately 100 million electron volts (MeV)). DOE's proposed modification would provide two additional limiting parameters (average beam power less than approximately 250 kilowatts (kW) and average current of 2.5 milliamperes (mA)). The voltage would be allowed to increase, as long as the resulting average current was 2.5 mA. Such result could be accomplished by lowering the power (wattage). Alternately, the wattage could increase if voltage decreased to result in an average current of 2.5 mA. DOE has determined that the use of three parameters will provide flexibility in the application of the categorical exclusion, but the actions still would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.11Outdoor Tests and Experiments on Materials and Equipment Components</HD>
          <P>The existing categorical exclusion precludes DOE from categorically excluding outdoor burn, impact, drop, puncture, and similar tests involving radiological sources, whether or not they were encapsulated. Because encapsulated sources can be used safely in these types of tests, DOE proposes to expand the scope of the categorical exclusion to cover their use under certain conditions. Specifically, DOE is proposing that nondestructive actions such as detector/sensor development and testing and first responder field training, using encapsulated sources that contain source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials, be included in the scope of this categorical exclusion. DOE experience demonstrates that such activities can be done safely and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.14Small-Scale Educational Facilities</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for the siting, construction or modification, operation, and decommissioning of small-scale educational facilities, including, but not limited to, conventional teaching laboratories, libraries, classroom facilities, auditoriums, museums, visitors centers, exhibits, and associated offices within or contiguous to a previously disturbed or developed area (where active utilities and currently used roads are readily accessible). Based on DOE's experience, and supported by past NEPA analyses, such activities, under the limitations provided, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.15Small-Scale Indoor Research and Development Projects Using Nanoscale Materials</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for the siting, construction, or modification, operation, and decommissioning of facilities for indoor small-scale research and development and small-scale pilot projects using nanoscale materials, in accordance with applicable requirements necessary to ensure the containment of any biohazardous materials. Construction or modification would be within or contiguous to an already developed area (where active utilities and currently used roads are readily accessible). This proposed categorical exclusion includes activities that are already in the scope of B3.6 (Small-scale research and development, laboratory operations, and pilot projects); however, as part of its rulemaking effort, DOE finds it appropriate to propose a categorical exclusion that specifically addresses nanoscale activities.</P>

          <P>DOE has extensive small-scale or laboratory-scale experience working with engineered (intentionally created, rather than natural or incidentally formed) nanoscale materials. For example, DOE is participating in interagency workgroups, such as the National Nanotechnology Initiative (<E T="03">http://www.nano.gov/html/about/home_about.html</E>), that seek to promote responsible research and development of nanotechnology, ensure that the important benefits to environmental protection that nanotechnology may offer are realized, and better understand any potential risks from exposure to nanomaterials in the environment. DOE conducts basic research and development that supports the National Nanotechnology Initiative at its nanoscale research centers, in accordance with DOE Policy 456.1 (DOE P 456.1, Secretarial Policy Statement on Nanoscale Safety), and best management practices and policies that ensure protection of workers and the environment, such as DOE Nanoscale Science Research Centers: Approach to Nanomaterials ES&amp;H, (Rev3a, May 2008) (“Approach to Nanomaterial ES&amp;H”) (<E T="03">http://orise.orau.gov/ihos/Nanotechnology/nanotech_DOE_Nanoscale_SC.html</E>). As explained in “Approach to Nanomaterial ES&amp;H,” “laboratory-scale” research excludes those activities whose function is to produce commercial quantities of materials, as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1450(b)(2), “Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories, Definitions.”</P>

          <P>Laboratory-scale experimentation with nanoscale materials has been the subject of four DOE EAs, in which the Department has analyzed the construction and operation of nanomaterials facilities. DOE has determined that, with appropriate controls in place (as specified in the proposed categorical exclusion and described above), these activities would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on this proposed categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B3.16Research Activities in Salt Water and Freshwater Environments</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for small-scale, temporary surveying, site characterization, and research actions to be performed in salt water and freshwater environments. DOE proposes limiting the actions covered by this categorical exclusion to the acquisition of rights-of-way, easements, and temporary use permits; data collection, environmental monitoring, and nondestructive research programs; resource evaluation activities; collection of various types of data and samples; installation of monitoring and recording devices; installation of equipment for flow testing of existing wells; and ecological and environmental research in a small area.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes specifically to exclude the construction or installation of permanent facilities or devices and to exclude the drilling of resource exploration or extraction wells. In addition, DOE has included several limits on the type, scope, and location of covered actions to protect the aquatic environment from potential significant impacts.</P>

          <P>DOE proposes to limit the covered actions in this categorical exclusion through the following conditions. Covered actions under this categorical exclusion would be conducted in accordance with, where applicable, an approved spill prevention, control, and response plan, and would incorporate appropriate control technologies and<PRTPAGE P="227"/>best management practices. Furthermore, none of the above activities would occur within the boundary of an established marine sanctuary or wildlife refuge, a governmentally proposed marine sanctuary or wildlife refuge, or a recognized area of high biological sensitivity, or outside those areas if the activities would have the potential to cause significant impacts within those areas. Additionally, no permanent facilities or devices would be constructed or installed. The categorical exclusion also lists other factors, specific to aquatic environments, to be considered by proponents of covered actions before applying this categorical exclusion to ensure that the activities would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>

          <P>DOE has determined that, subject to the proposed limitations, the activities would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on this categorical exclusion due to heightened sensitivity to activities in the salt water environment in light of recent oil-related incidents.

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Categorical Exclusions Applicable to Power Resources (B4)</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to make a number of recurring changes to the categorical exclusion provisions applicable to power resources. In reference to adding electric power resources (such as wind farms) into an electric power system, DOE proposes to use the term “interconnection” rather than the term “integration” now used in its existing classes of actions. “Interconnection” is the current term used in the electric transmission field for such actions. DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B4.1, B4.11, B4.12, B4.13.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to delete references to “main transmission system” in its existing classes of actions as unnecessary because DOE actions would only apply to its own transmission system. DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B4.11, B4.12.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to add pipeline rights-of-way as locations where actions could occur that are now categorically excluded or proposed for categorical exclusion in previously developed or disturbed transmission line rights-of-way. The impacts from siting, constructing, operating, or decommissioning actions in these linear rights-of-way are essentially similar. DOE, therefore, proposes changes to the following provisions: B4.7, B4.12. (DOE also proposes a similar change to EA class of actions C4.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.1Contracts, Policies, and Marketing and Allocation Plans for Electric Power</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to simplify the description of the scope of this categorical exclusion, without changing the scope. The categorical exclusion would still apply to electric power contracts, policies, and plans that do not involve a new generation resource and do not involve changes in the normal operating limits of existing generation resources. DOE proposes to delete the existing reference to “excess electric power” as unnecessary as it simply applies to power that is available for transmission. DOE is proposing changes to its corresponding classes of actions for EAs (C7) and EISs (D7), as discussed below in Section IV.F and IV.G, respectively.</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the proposed revisions to this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.4Power Marketing Services and Activities</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to clarify this categorical exclusion by adding “power management activities” to its existing categorical exclusion for power marketing services to indicate that the activities that are appropriately categorically excluded do not necessarily need to be taken in the context of marketing power. The existing categorical exclusion was established based on the experience of DOE's power marketing administrations, but has been appropriately applied recently by other elements of the Department, for example, in evaluating actions under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The proposed change would provide transparency to DOE's application of this categorical exclusion, and DOE has determined that the covered actions would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>

          <P>DOE proposes to add “load shaping projects (such as the installation and use of flywheels and battery arrays)” to the list of example actions in this categorical exclusion.

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.7Fiber Optic Cable</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes that certain actions associated with adding fiber optic cable to transmission facilities (such as vaults and pulling and tensioning sites) be within the scope of this categorical exclusion with certain limitations. DOE has found that it is often necessary to place vaults and pulling and tensioning sites outside of rights-of-way. DOE has determined that, if vaults or such sites are in nearby previously disturbed or developed areas, they would not have the potential to cause significant environmental impact.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.9Multiple Use of Transmission Line Rights-of-Way</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to add examples of crossing agreements affecting a transmission facility's rights-of-way that DOE has determined are in the scope of this categorical exclusion, namely natural gas pipelines, communications cables, and roads.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.10Removal of Electric Transmission Lines and Substations</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to add “abandonment” and “restoration” of rights-of-way to the list of activities in this categorical exclusion, because DOE has determined that these actions, which generally follow the removal of electric transmission lines and substations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.11Electric Power Substations and Interconnection Facilities</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to add interconnection facilities to its categorical exclusion for construction or modification of electric power substations because the facilities have similar equipment and function. Substations switch, step down, or regulate voltage of electricity being transmitted, and may serve as controls and transfer points on a transmission system; interconnection facilities add electric power resources to transmission systems through similar functions.</P>

          <P>DOE proposes that actions under this categorical exclusion, instead of being limited to those that do not interconnect a new generation resource (under the existing categorical exclusion), be limited to interconnecting new generation resources that meet two conditions: The new generation resource (1) would be eligible for categorical exclusion under the DOE NEPA regulations (that is, under proposed categorical exclusions for combined heat and power or cogeneration systems (B5.14), solar energy (B5.16 and B5.17), wind energy (B5.18), biomass power plants (B5.20), methane gas recovery and utilization systems (B5.21) and drop-in hydroelectric systems (B5.24)), and (2) would be equal to or less than 50<PRTPAGE P="228"/>average megawatts (which is considered a major resource under the Northwest Power Act).</P>
          <P>DOE is also proposing to delete actions regarding construction, upgrading, or rebuilding transmission lines from this categorical exclusion because substation actions do not necessarily involve transmission line actions. Categorically excluded transmission line actions are addressed in proposed B4.12 and B4.13.</P>
          <P>DOE is proposing to delete the restriction that facilities under this categorical exclusion be limited to no more than 230 kilovolts because DOE has determined that voltage of a substation or interconnection facility is not a determinant of the potential for significant environmental impacts.</P>
          <P>In response to the Department's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor suggested that DOE categorically exclude modifications and upgrades to existing substations to accommodate electricity generated from renewable energy sources, to the extent that an upgrade does not increase the overall capacity of the substation or the disturbed areas associated with the substation, noting that additional capacity is needed at substations throughout the electric grid. DOE notes that it is proposing to delete the restriction that facilities under this categorical exclusion be limited to no more than 230 kilovolts.</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on the proposed revisions to this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B4.12Construction of Transmission Lines</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to incorporate within the scope of categorical exclusion B4.12 an action currently addressed in the existing categorical exclusion B4.11, that is “relocation of existing electric transmission lines approximately 20 miles in length or less.” By doing so, transmission line construction and rebuilding activities will be consolidated in categorical exclusions B4.12 and B4.13, rather than also included in categorical exclusion B4.11, which predominantly relates to substations and interconnection facilities. DOE's long-term experience with electric transmission line construction indicates that the approximately 10-mile limit for categorical exclusion of transmission line construction outside of a previously disturbed or developed right-of-way, and the approximately 20-mile limit for categorical exclusion of transmission line in a previously disturbed right-of-way, have been reliable guides to the appropriate level of NEPA review for the actions.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes that actions under this categorical exclusion, instead of being limited to those that do not interconnect a new generation resource (as under the existing categorical exclusion), be limited to interconnecting new generation resources that meet the two conditions discussed with respect to categorical exclusion B4.11.</P>
          <P>In response to the Department's December 2009 Request for Information, one commentor suggested that the addition of transmission lines to existing transmission line or pipeline rights-of-way be categorically excluded. The commentor noted that additional transmission capacity is required to move electricity generated by renewable resources to population centers and that adding that capacity in an existing right-of-way will have very little environmental impact. DOE agrees and does not restrict the addition of transmission lines to an existing transmission or pipeline right-of-way if the limitations specified in the categorical exclusion are met.</P>

          <P>In B5.1, DOE proposes four types of changes to the existing categorical exclusion: (1) Adding examples to better represent the type of energy conservation actions, including those for which DOE provides financial assistance, that fall within the scope of this categorical exclusion, (2) adding actions to conserve water, (3) deleting reference to renewable energy research and development because DOE is proposing separate categorical exclusions for those actions (under B5.15 and B5.25 below), and (4) including new B5.1(b).</P>
          <P>In B5.1(a), DOE proposes to clarify the scope of the categorical exclusion by providing additional examples of conservation actions similar in nature to the existing examples, such as weatherization, energy efficiency for vehicles and transportation (such as fleet change out), power storage (such as flywheels and batteries, generally less than 10 MW), and transportation management systems (such as traffic signal control systems). DOE's experience with these proposed covered actions demonstrate that they fit within the scope of the categorical exclusion. In addition, to ensure that the categorical exclusion would not encompass actions with potentially significant impacts on the human environment, DOE proposes to clarify that the actions include building renovations or new structures, provided that they occur in a previously disturbed or developed area. Also, DOE proposes to clarify that the categorical exclusion could also involve actions in the academic or institutional sectors.</P>

          <P>In B5.1(b), DOE proposes to include rulemakings that establish energy conservation standards in the scope of this categorical exclusion. DOE has prepared numerous EAs and FONSIs for rulemakings that establish energy conservation standards for consumer products and industrial equipment and has determined that, within the limitations on the scope of actions that could be taken under the proposed categorical exclusion, establishment of such standards would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. The limitations on scope of actions concern changes in manufacturing infrastructure, uses of available resources, disposal, and energy consumption. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on B5.1(b) of this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.2Modifications to Pumps and Piping</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes to broaden the scope of this categorical exclusion by not limiting it to oil, gas, and geothermal facilities, but by providing examples of materials that could be conveyed by pump and piping configurations (that is, by adding as examples, air, brine, carbon dioxide, produced water, steam, and water to the currently listed materials). DOE also proposes to clarify<PRTPAGE P="229"/>that the existing reference to “gas” includes natural gas, hydrogen gas, and nitrogen gas. DOE has determined that the environmental impacts resulting from modifications to pump and piping configurations on systems conveying such materials would be similar to impacts from modifications to the pump and piping configurations on systems carrying the existing categorically excluded materials. DOE's experience with these materials has demonstrated that modifying such pump and piping configurations would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.3Modification or Abandonment of Wells</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to broaden the scope of this categorical exclusion for storage and injection wells by not limiting the wells to those for oil, brine, geothermal, and gas wells, but by adding these wells as examples: Carbon dioxide, coalbed methane, and gas hydrate wells. DOE's experience has demonstrated that actions associated with the modification and abandonment (including plugging) of carbon dioxide and similar wells normally do not have the potential to cause significant impacts. DOE is proposing to limit use of the categorical exclusion to situations where there is low potential for seismicity, subsidence, and contamination of freshwater aquifers and where the actions are otherwise consistent with best practices and DOE protocols, including those that protect against uncontrolled releases of harmful materials. DOE is also proposing to clarify that “gas” in the existing categorical exclusion refers to natural gas.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.4Repair or Replacement of Pipelines</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to broaden the scope of this categorical exclusion by not limiting it to actions including oil, produced water, brine, and geothermal pipelines, but also to exclude repair and replacement actions on pipelines carrying materials similar in nature (such as air, carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas, natural gas, nitrogen gas, steam, and water). In DOE's experience, the conveyance of the proposed additional materials similar to those currently categorically excluded normally does not pose a potential to cause significant impacts. DOE also proposes to clarify that upgrading, rebuilding, and minor relocation may be involved in repair or replacement of pipelines. Further, DOE proposes to list Army Corps of Engineer permits as one type of requirement that may apply to these actions, while also acknowledging that there may be others.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.5Short Pipeline Segments</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to broaden the scope of this categorical exclusion by not limiting it to oil, steam, geothermal or natural gas resources, but by providing additional examples (air, brine, carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, produced water, and water) of materials potentially conveyed by pipeline segments under this categorical exclusion. The potential impacts resulting from pipelines conveying the additional materials would be similar to those from the existing categorically excluded materials. DOE's experience conveying these materials has demonstrated that they would not have the potential to cause significant impacts.</P>
          <P>DOE further proposes to remove the limitation that pipelines must be within a single industrial complex. DOE proposes to remove that limitation because potential impacts do not depend on whether the action is conducted within an arbitrary boundary. DOE is therefore proposing to replace the reference to “DOE facilities” with references to “existing source facilities” and “existing receiving facilities.” Categorically excluded actions are limited to short pipelines, which DOE proposes be generally less than 20 miles in length in previously developed or disturbed areas.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.6Oil Spill Cleanup</HD>
          <P>DOE is proposing to clarify that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan is not necessarily the only applicable requirement for oil spill cleanup by making this an example of an applicable requirement.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.12Workover of Existing Wells</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes to broaden the scope of this categorical exclusion by not limiting it to oil, gas, and geothermal wells, but by providing additional examples (brine, carbon dioxide, coalbed methane and gas hydrate) of wells that could be restored to functionality. DOE's experience with these materials has demonstrated that the potential impacts would be similar in nature to the impacts of wells using materials named in the existing categorical exclusion and that workover of such wells would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. In addition, DOE is proposing to limit use of the categorical exclusion to situations where there is low potential for seismicity, subsidence, and contamination of freshwater aquifers, and where the actions are otherwise consistent with best practices and DOE protocols, including those that protect against uncontrolled releases of harmful materials. DOE is also proposing to clarify that “gas” in the existing categorical exclusion refers to “natural gas.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.13Experimental Wells for the Injection of Small Quantities of Carbon Dioxide</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for experimental wells for the injection of small quantities of carbon dioxide in locally characterized geologically secure storage formations at or near existing carbon dioxide sources. The activities encompassed in the new proposed categorical exclusion are intended to help determine the suitability of geological formations for large-scale sequestration, as information from small-scale projects can be used to ensure that commercial-scale projects can be conducted safely and in an environmentally sound manner.</P>

          <P>The proposed categorical exclusion is supported by DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory's experience with carbon sequestration wells, through DOE-directed research projects and collaboration with the nationwide network of regional carbon sequestration partnerships tasked with determining the best technologies for carbon capture, storage, and sequestration. Through this work, DOE has gained substantial experience with small-scale carbon sequestration, showing that these projects can be managed safely and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. In addition, the proposed categorical exclusion is supported by FONSIs for<PRTPAGE P="230"/>three DOE EAs for projects with scales ranging up to one million tons of carbon dioxide over the lifetime of the project (typically one to four years).</P>

          <P>Based on experience with small-scale projects, DOE proposes that the injection of carbon dioxide under this categorical exclusion be limited to, in aggregate, less than 500,000 tons over the duration of a project. In addition, DOE also proposes a number of conditions that the project must meet in order for the activity to be categorically excluded. For example, the proposed categorical exclusion would require that characterization has verified a low potential for seismicity, subsidence, and contamination of freshwater aquifers. DOE's proposed limitations will ensure that injection of carbon dioxide at this scale would not have significant impacts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on this categorical exclusion, including the limit of 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide over the duration of the project.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.14Combined Heat and Power or Cogeneration Systems</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for the conversion to, and replacement or modification of, combined heat and power or cogeneration systems at existing facilities provided that the action would not have the potential to cause a significant increase in the quantity or rate of air emissions and would not have the potential to cause significant impacts to water resources.</P>
          <P>DOE has determined that combined heat and power or cogeneration system activities under this categorical exclusion, when subject to the proposed limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts because (1) these systems would be modifications to existing systems, and thus generally would not involve more than minor changes to facility footprints and do not involve major new construction, and (2) these systems would improve operating efficiency (such as making use of otherwise waste heat) and thus would be designed to lessen potential impacts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.15Small-Scale Renewable Energy Research and Development and Pilot Projects</HD>

          <P>As part of DOE's proposal to clarify and focus existing categorical exclusion B5.1 on energy efficiency and conservation actions (including research and development-related actions), DOE proposes a separate categorical exclusion for small-scale renewable energy research and development and pilot projects. In doing so, DOE proposes to limit the covered actions to those in previously disturbed and developed areas and to emphasize that such actions would be in accordance with applicable requirements and incorporate appropriate controls and practices.<E T="03">See also</E>B5.25 for small-scale renewable energy research and development and pilot projects in salt water and freshwater environments.</P>
          <P>In addition, this proposal is responsive to a commentor's suggestion to have a categorical exclusion for small-scale pilot projects for renewable energy generation, modeled on DOE's existing categorical exclusion B6.2 for pilot-scale waste collection and treatment facilities.</P>
          <P>DOE is particularly interested in receiving comments on this categorical exclusion.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.16-B5.24</HD>

          <P>As part of DOE's proposal to clarify and focus existing categorical exclusion B5.1 on energy efficiency and conservation actions, and in response to commentors' suggestions to include more explicitly renewable energy technologies, DOE is proposing several new categorical exclusions. DOE proposes eight new categorical exclusion classes of actions involving renewable energy technologies, as described below. The proposed categorical exclusions apply to the installation, modification, operation, and removal of small-scale, commercially available renewable energy technologies. DOE proposes to specify conditions by technology (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>wind) to ensure appropriate limitations, but does not generally set limits on energy output because DOE experience and data review suggest that the potential for significant impacts is more closely related to the site selected for a renewable energy project and the interaction of resources at a selected site with the renewable technology. DOE has proposed specific limitations for these categorical exclusions to ensure that any renewable energy technology project that would have the potential to cause significant impacts to particular resources would be identified as outside the scope of the categorical exclusion. Further, DOE proposes one new class of actions involving electric vehicle charging stations.</P>
          <P>The proposed categorical exclusions in B5.16-B5.24 identify many of the types of projects for which DOE has made categorical exclusion determinations based on existing categorical exclusion B5.1. The actions listed in these proposed categorical exclusions are also consistent with categorical exclusions promulgated by other Federal agencies, EAs and FONSIs prepared by DOE and other Federal agencies, the opinions of subject matter experts, and private sector experience developing and deploying renewable energy technologies. DOE has determined that the activities under these categorical exclusions, when subject to the proposed limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts because the categorical exclusions apply specifically to systems that are: (1) Located on or adjacent to existing structures, or on previously developed or disturbed land, (2) sited in accordance with local land use and zoning requirements, and (3) designed to incorporate appropriate control technologies and best management practices to lessen potential impacts.</P>
          <P>The proposed categorical exclusions are responsive to the numerous suggestions that DOE received, both from within DOE and in response to its December 2009 Request for Information, to include explicitly renewable energy technologies and associated equipment in its categorical exclusions. Several commentors also suggested that DOE categorically exclude actions intended to “co-locate renewables” or to support “distributed generation projects.” These suggestions describe similar actions that: (1) Support the operation of an existing facility by providing a renewable energy source on-site, (2) would be compatible with existing land use, and (3) would require minimal to no expansion of the footprint of an existing facility. As a result, DOE's review of available data led it to propose to exclude select small-scale, renewable energy technology projects, under specified proposed conditions, for the purpose of providing a renewable energy generation capability to existing facilities (specifically, B5.16-B5.21).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.16Solar Photovoltaic Systems</HD>

          <P>The actions listed in categorical exclusion B5.16 apply to the installation, modification, operation, and removal of commercially available solar photovoltaic systems located on a building or other existing structure (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>covered parking facility), or on land generally comprising less than 10 acres. The actions listed are consistent with DOE and other Federal agency experience with “co-located” solar photovoltaic energy projects generally comprising less than 10 acres within a previously disturbed or developed area, categorical exclusion determinations DOE has made based on existing regulations, categorical exclusions<PRTPAGE P="231"/>promulgated by other Federal agencies, EAs and FONSIs prepared by DOE and other Federal agencies, and the opinions of subject matter experts. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>

          <P>DOE has determined that the solar photovoltaic system activities under this categorical exclusion, when subject to proposed limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts because (1) these are systems located on or adjacent to existing structures, or on previously developed or disturbed land, and thus generally involve no more than minor changes to facility footprints and do not involve major new construction, and (2) these systems generally would support the operation of an existing facility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>providing an on-site, renewable electricity generation source).

Such turbines must be located within previously disturbed or developed areas; more than 10 miles from an airport or aviation navigation aid; and more than 1.5 nautical miles from National Weather Service or Federal Aviation Administration Doppler weather radar. Also such turbines must not have the potential to cause significant impacts to bird or bat species and must be appropriately designed and located so as to not cause significant impacts to persons (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>noise or shadow flicker). These actions are consistent with categorical exclusion determinations DOE has made based on existing regulations, EAs and FONSIs prepared by DOE and other Federal agencies, and the opinions of subject matter experts.

          <P>DOE has determined that the methane recovery and utilization system activities under this categorical exclusion, when subject to the proposed limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts because (1) these are modifications to existing waste disposal or treatment facilities, and thus generally involve no more than minor changes to facility footprints and do not involve major new construction, and (2) these modifications generally would improve operating efficiency (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>making use of otherwise waste gas for energy production at existing facilities) and thus would be designed to lessen potential impacts.

The actions listed in this proposed categorical exclusion are consistent with categorical exclusion determinations DOE has made based on existing regulations for alternative fuel vehicle fueling technologies and an EA and FONSI prepared by DOE. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>

          <P>DOE has determined that the alternative vehicle fueling system activities under this categorical exclusion, when subject to proposed limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts because these are systems located at existing stations, or on previously developed or disturbed land, and thus generally involve no more than minor changes to facility footprints and do not involve major new construction. These systems would support the operation and use of alternative fuel vehicles (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>providing the fueling infrastructure necessary to support the use of vehicles run on alternative fuels).

          <P>DOE has determined that the electric vehicle charging station activities under this categorical exclusion, when subject to proposed limitations, would not have the potential to cause significant impacts because these are systems located on previously developed or disturbed land, and thus generally do not involve major new construction.

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">B5.24Drop-in Hydroelectric Systems</HD>
          <P>DOE proposes a new categorical exclusion for the installation, modification, operation, and removal of commercially available small-scale, drop-in, run-of-the-river hydroelectric systems where there would not be the potential for significant impacts to threatened and endangered species or significant impacts on water quality, temperature, flow, or volume.</P>

          <P>The term “run-of-the-river” as used in this categorical exclusion refers to hydroelectric systems that would be fully dependent on the natural flow of the river or stream at the point of system installation; would have no water storage, such as in an impoundment; and would involve no water diversion from the stream or river. The term “drop-in” refers to prefabricated systems that are placed in a river or stream, not systems that are constructed in a river or stream such as a dam. Under this categorical exclusion, DOE envisions small turbines placed in a stream or river for small operations, where all energy would likely be consumed on-site (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>for a home, ranch, or other small commercial operation) and unlikely to be put on the commercial grid. Hydroelectric systems capable of producing electricity for the commercial grid would likely be secured in a channel (requiring the use of heavy equipment), may require channel modification, and may have a potential to significantly affect fish, wildlife, habitat, and water flow and quality; these systems would be excluded from the scope of this categorical exclusion. The actions listed in this proposed categorical exclusion are consistent with the opinions of subject matter experts, including fish biologists with regulatory and fisheries management experience. (<E T="03">See</E>the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <P>DOE has determined that the activities under this categorical exclusion would not have the potential to cause significant impacts when subject to the proposed limitations: involve no water storage or water diversion; be located only in areas upstream of a natural anadromous fish barrier (such as a waterfall that has historically prevented anadromous fish passage); and involve no major construction, modification of stream or river channels, or the use of heavy equipment. Projects in the scope of this categorical exclusion generally support adjacent uses with a renewable source of direct electricity production.

Research with respect to wave or tidal energy or the growth and harvest of algae as biomass for proof of concept purposes would be appropriate projects in this class of actions. However, as with B3.16, DOE proposes to impose similar limits on the scope and location of the activities to ensure that renewable energy research is conducted in a manner that would not have the potential to cause significant impacts. These actions are consistent with categorical exclusion determinations DOE has made based on existing regulations, EAs and FONSIs prepared by other Federal agencies, and the opinions of subject matter experts. (See the Technical Support Document.)</P>
          <P>DOE proposes specifically to exclude the construction or installation of permanent facilities or devices and to exclude the drilling of wells for resource exploration or extraction. In addition, DOE has included several limits on the type, scope, and location of covered actions to protect the aquatic environment from potential significant impacts.</P>
          <P>DOE proposes to limit the covered actions in this categorical exclusion through the following conditions. Covered actions under this categorical exclusion would be conducted in accordance with, where applicable, an approved spill prevention, control, and response plan, and would incorporate appropriate control technologies and best management practices. Furthermore, none of the above activities would occur (1) within areas of hazardous natural bottom conditions, or (2) within the boundary of an established marine sanctuary or wildlife refuge, a governmentally proposed marine sanctuary or wildlife refuge, or a recognized area of high biological sensitivity, or outside those areas if the activities would have the potential to cause significant impacts within those areas. Additionally, no permanent facilities or devices would be constructed or installed. The categorical exclusion also lists other factors, specific to aquatic environments, to be considered by proponents of covered actions before applying this categorical exclusion to ensure that the activities would not have the potential to have significant impacts.</P>

DOE proposes to retain a specified limit to cost, but to raise the limit from approximately $5 million to approximately $10 million, in light of the fact that this cost limitation has not been revised since 1996. DOE also proposes to add encapsulation, physical or chemical separation, and compaction to the examples of treatment methods. DOE proposes to change the text of the categorical exclusion from “would not affect future groundwater remediation” to “would not unduly limit future groundwater remediation” because a literal reading of the existing categorical exclusion would bar its use if there were any affect on future groundwater remediation.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">D5[Removed and Reserved: Main Transmission System Additions]</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">D6[Removed and Reserved: Integrating Transmission Facilities]</HD>

          <P>DOE proposes deleting D5, Main transmission system additions, and D6, Integrating transmission facilities, because there is redundancy and ambiguity between D5 and D6 that makes them of limited utility. Furthermore, there is overlap between D5 (addition of new lines) and C4 (construction of new lines) in the current regulations, which makes it difficult to discern which category is appropriate for a specific project. DOE also proposes not to have EIS categories that correspond to the categorical exclusions and the EA class of actions that address the level of NEPA review for electric transmission facilities and lines (B4.11, B4.12, B4.13, and C4). Based on DOE experience, the level of NEPA review for transmission facilities and lines that are not categorically excluded is at least at an EA level, but does not necessarily warrant an EIS level. DOE has found that the determination whether an EA or an EIS is appropriate is project-specific (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>type and size of facility) and site-specific (<E T="03">e.g.,</E>site conditions, other facilities and lines in the area, or the proximity of residences). Working with its stakeholders, DOE has often successfully mitigated potentially significant impacts so that an EA level of review is often adequate. In those cases where an EA is not applicable, DOE completes an EIS, and the lack of an EIS category in this proposed rulemaking does not preclude such action in the future.

          <P>DOE reviewed and evaluated each of the suggestions provided by the 11 respondents to its December 2009 Request for Information, as discussed above in Section II. Many of the comments included proposals for new categorical exclusions and revisions to limit or expand existing categorical exclusions, or were related to other existing provisions in subpart D of the DOE NEPA regulations. In addition to comments related to specific provisions, which are discussed above in Section IV.C through IV.G, DOE received comments of a more general nature, not associated with a particular provision. These comments and DOE's responses are presented below.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Categorical exclusions, generally.</E>In its Request for Information, DOE described categorical exclusions as categories of actions that normally do not have the potential, individually or cumulatively, to have a significant effect on the “human environment.” One commentor expressed a concern that DOE focused too narrowly on the human environment and “seems to miss the true purpose of the NEPA process.” In addition, a commentor stated that the DOE categorical exclusion process should “explicitly include recognition of the Department's trust and trustee duties and responsibilities that ensure actions evaluated for categorical exclusion do not adversely impact the environment or violate these responsibilities.” DOE's characterization of a categorical exclusion in its Request for Information is consistent with the definition of categorical exclusion in the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.4), and DOE applies the comprehensive interpretation of “human environment” as defined in the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.14) “to include the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment.”</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Land transfers.</E>A commentor stated that DOE should not use a categorical exclusion when land transfers have the potential to impact Tribal Nations' rights, uses, or historical, religious or cultural assets, or DOE should ensure that those rights are preserved and that there is adequate government-to-government consultation.</P>

          <P>DOE conducts its government-to-government consultations with Tribal Nations in accordance with its American Indian Tribal Government Policy, as outlined in DOE Order 1230.2. With respect to Federally recognized Indian Tribe interests, also<E T="03">see</E>Section IV.E for a discussion of appendix B(4) conditions that are integral elements of appendix B categorical exclusions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Land and water contaminated with radioactive and/or hazardous materials.</E>A commentor noted that many of DOE's facilities, and the land and water beneath these facilities, are contaminated with radioactive and/or hazardous materials. The commentor stated that DOE should not allow for the transfer or lease of contaminated facilities and land through a categorical exclusion. DOE is proposing changes to DOE's land transfer-related categorical exclusions. Proposed categorical exclusions B1.24 and B1.25 pertain to the transfer, lease, disposition, or acquisition of interests (personal property and real property). Both proposed B1.24 and B1.25 contain limitations such that they may not be applied if there is a “potential for release of substances at a level, or in a form, that could pose a threat to public health<PRTPAGE P="235"/>and the environment.” For further information,<E T="03">see</E>the detailed discussion of proposed changes to A7, B1.24, and B1.25 in Section IV.D and IV.E, above.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Construction and operation of facilities.</E>A commentor stated that “most construction of facilities (even temporary)” should not be performed under a categorical exclusion. Construction and operation under the Department's existing and proposed categorical exclusions are limited to certain types of small-scale facilities that DOE has determined would not have potential to cause significant impacts when the conditions specified in the categorical exclusion and the integral elements in appendix B(4) are considered. Under DOE's existing NEPA regulations these include, for example, support buildings (such as cafeterias), small-scale wastewater and surface water treatment facilities, and microwave and communications towers. DOE is now proposing to add recycling drop-off stations and small-scale educational facilities to that list. DOE has determined that, absent extraordinary circumstances, these types of actions are appropriately categorically excluded.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Mitigation actions.</E>A commentor stated that mitigation actions, such as reseeding and revegetation, should not conflict with existing mitigation, restoration, and preservation activities or exacerbate environmental contamination, and that DOE's procedures for categorical exclusion determinations should include a checklist to ensure that the potential for such conflicts is considered in applying a categorical exclusion. DOE's existing and proposed categorical exclusion regulations require determinations that there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the proposal's environmental effects. The regulations also require that the proposal not be connected to other actions with significant impacts or related to other actions with cumulatively significant impacts. DOE believes that these existing procedures adequately address this concern.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Rulemaking process.</E>A commentor stated that DOE should distribute draft categorical exclusion determinations and supporting documents to those who have specific interests or oversight responsibilities for DOE sites, providing a 30-day comment period. DOE respectfully disagrees with this proposal. Such a process would be counter to the purpose of a categorical exclusion, which is to expedite the environmental review process for proposed actions that normally do not require more resource intensive EAs or EISs. Before an agency can establish a categorical exclusion, however, an agency is required to provide an opportunity for public review of those actions that it intends to exclude. Through the publication of this notice of proposed rulemaking, DOE is providing its proposed changes to the public and providing an opportunity for public review and comment. Additionally, DOE is required to consult with CEQ on conformity of the proposed categorical exclusions with NEPA and the CEQ NEPA implementing procedures.</P>
          <P>A commentor requested that DOE's December 2009 Request For Information “not be used to remove types of projects that are currently required to perform an EA or EIS.” As discussed further in Section IV.G, DOE is proposing to remove two classes of actions that are now listed as normally requiring an EIS, D5, Main transmission system additions, and D6, Integrating transmission facilities. DOE has found that, for the most part, it has been able to mitigate impacts such that those impacts are not significant. DOE is proposing to remove one EA class of actions (C2, Rate increases more than inflation, not power marketing). DOE has not been able to identify any proposed action that has been included in that class of actions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">New technologies.</E>A commentor requested that “if the effects of new technologies in the private and public sectors are going to influence” the proposed categorical exclusions, the technologies and their impacts must be fully explained. DOE has based its proposed categorical exclusions on its previous NEPA reviews, expert advice, categorical exclusions of other Federal agencies, and private sector experience, and it has explained the basis for its proposed decisions both here and in the Technical Support Document.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Geothermal.</E>A commentor requested that no further regulations be promulgated that would make it more difficult to obtain permitting for the installation of geothermal wells. The commentor also emphasized the “tremendous energy savings” provided by geothermal heat pumps for heating and cooling buildings.</P>
          <P>DOE currently has an existing categorical exclusion, B3.7, for the siting, construction, and operation of new infill exploratory and experimental (test) wells, including geothermal wells, drilled in a geological formation that has existing operating wells. Although DOE is proposing to add certain restrictions, DOE does not believe these changes would make the permitting process for geothermal wells more difficult. In addition, DOE is proposing a new categorical exclusion, B5.19, for the installation, modification, operation, and removal of commercially available small-scale ground source heat pumps to support operations in single facilities or contiguous facilities. (See discussion of B3.7 and B5.19 in Section IV.E, above.)</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Renewable energy projects.</E>A commentor suggested that DOE adopt a “fast-track” review process for renewable energy projects, similar to a process that the Bureau of Land Management, an agency within the Department of the Interior, has adopted. DOE is a cooperating agency with the Bureau of Land Management on several of its EISs for renewable energy proposals (for example, for proposals for which an application for a loan guarantee has been submitted to DOE), and is familiar with the Bureau's process. In other cases, DOE's Program Offices (for example, the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, the Loan Program Office, and Bonneville Power Administration) work as expeditiously as possible on NEPA and other necessary reviews (such as electric system reliability review and financial review) needed before project approval. Part of DOE's aim in proposing updates to its categorical exclusions is to expedite the environmental review process for proposals that normally do not require more resource intensive EAs or EISs. DOE's proposed new categorical exclusions include (1) eight specifically for installation, modification, operation, and removal of commercially available renewable energy technologies (as listed in the proposed categorical exclusions B5.16 to B5.22, inclusive, and B5.24) and (2) small-scale renewable energy research and development and pilot projects (B5.15 and B5.25). DOE expects that the use of these categorical exclusions will allow for more expeditious NEPA review for projects that fit within the classes of actions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Biofuels production projects.</E>A commentor suggested that DOE categorically exclude new biofuels production projects, “provided that certain conditions are met with respect to air and water emissions, water consumption and other high-level considerations.” At this time, DOE is not proposing a categorical exclusion for commercial-scale biofuels production projects. First, the Department conducted a survey of Federal agencies' NEPA regulations and did not identify existing (or proposed) categorical exclusions for new commercial biofuels projects that could guide DOE in proposing an appropriate scope for such<PRTPAGE P="236"/>a category. Second, a Notice of Funds Availability published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Business Cooperative Service regarding new construction and retrofitting of advanced biofuels facilities (non-corn ethanol) concluded that such facilities would not meet the classification of a categorical exclusion (75 FR 25076; May 6, 2010). DOE, nevertheless, is requesting input from the public as to whether a categorical exclusion for commercial-scale biofuel production projects would be appropriate, and, if so, what limits might be applicable (for example, throughput and operation parameters).</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Consistency among Federal and State categorical exclusions.</E>A commentor suggested that DOE should work with States to create consistency among Federal and State categorical exclusions because there is a disconnect between what the Federal government categorically excludes under NEPA and what States exclude under their environmental review provisions. DOE develops its categorical exclusions based on classes of actions it has identified that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment based on actions it has considered nationwide. DOE does not have any involvement in how a State assigns particular classes of actions to a particular level of environmental review. However, States have the opportunity to comment on an agency's proposed categorical exclusions and associated administrative records and also to consider whether to change their own categorical exclusions or other implementing procedures based on a Federal agency's exclusions. DOE welcomes comments from States on DOE's categorical exclusions and, in particular, as to a State's experience with similar exclusions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Evaluation of greenhouse gases.</E>A commentor noted that CEQ had stated that it sees no basis for excluding greenhouse gases from NEPA jurisdiction. The commentor suggested that DOE have additional categorical exclusions “to protect against abuse of this expansive new jurisdiction by entities seeking to stop or stall projects.” In proposing 20 new categorical exclusions and modifying others to promote efficiency in the NEPA process while ensuring protection of the environment, DOE has considered the potential for significant environmental impacts, including potential impacts from greenhouse gas emissions. DOE's approach in this regard is consistent with draft guidance issued in February 2010 by CEQ, Consideration of the Effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions (<E T="03">http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/Consideration_of_Effects_of_GHG_Draft_NEPA_Guidance_FINAL_02182010.pdf</E>). The draft guidance states, “In many cases, the [greenhouse gas] emissions of the proposed action may be so small as to be a negligible consideration. Agency NEPA procedures may identify actions for which [greenhouse gas] emissions and other environmental effects are neither individually or cumulatively significant. 40 CFR 1507.3.” The draft guidance further states that, in proposing that the NEPA process incorporate consideration of both the impact of an agency action on the environment through the mechanism of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of changing climate on that agency action, “This is not intended as a `new' component of NEPA analysis, but rather as a potentially important factor to be considered within the existing NEPA framework.”</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Level of involvement necessary to require a NEPA review (or “Federal handle”).</E>A commentor requested that DOE provide guidance on the level of Federal involvement necessary to categorize a project as “Federal,” thereby triggering an environmental review under NEPA. Specifically, the commentor suggested that DOE consider setting a minimum threshold of 10% of the overall project budget as a funding level that would trigger NEPA, and further, that only Federal funds actually allocated to the project should be counted (that is, budgeted or anticipated funds should be excluded in determining the level of Federal financing). The commentor requested that factors be specified to help determine what level of Federal control or involvement is needed for NEPA to be triggered.</P>
          <P>In determining whether an action constitutes a major Federal action for purposes of NEPA, DOE considers the degree of Federal control over or involvement in a project. As part of this consideration, DOE examines the total amount and percentage of Federal funding among other factors. In many cases, the fact that Federal government funding is in the range of 10 percent (or less) of total project costs will make the percentage of Federal funding an important factor in finding that an action is not a major Federal action. These are essentially the same factors suggested by the commentor. DOE also may consider other factors specific to the proposed action at issue. DOE finds this case-by-case approach workable and consistent with applicable precedent and does not propose to establish specific criteria through this proposed rulemaking for determining whether a proposed action constitutes a major Federal action.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Uranium mineral activities.</E>A commentor, noting interest in uranium mineral exploration, development, and reclamation activities on DOE uranium leases in Western Colorado, stated that “activities related to mining and mineral exploration on Department of Energy mineral leases should remain barred from categorical exclusion.” DOE's proposed revisions to the Department's NEPA regulations would not allow categorical exclusion of uranium mineral development. However, under certain conditions, some exploration and reclamation actions could be categorically excluded under DOE's existing and proposed categorical exclusions, such as, categorical exclusion B3.1, Site characterization and environmental monitoring, and categorical exclusion B6.1, Cleanup actions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Cost parameters for environmental review under NEPA.</E>A commentor suggested that the estimated cost of a project be factored into the categorical exclusion process. Specifically, the commentor suggested that DOE establish an upper limit of $25 million (estimated cost) for a proposed action that can be categorically excluded and a lower limit of $100 million (estimated cost) over which a proposed action requires an EIS. DOE has determined that cost is generally not a reliable indicator of environmental impacts and is not proposing to establish general cost parameters to dictate the level of NEPA review in its regulations. One exception is categorical exclusion B6.1, which contains a cost limit for small-scale, short-term cleanup actions.<E T="03">See</E>discussion of B6.1 in Section IV.E above.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Procedural Requirements</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Review Under Executive Order 12866</HD>
          <P>Today's proposed rule has been determined to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was subject to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>

          <P>In this proposed rule, DOE proposes amendments that establish, modify, and clarify procedures for considering the environmental effects of DOE actions within DOE's decisionmaking process,<PRTPAGE P="237"/>thereby enhancing compliance with the letter and spirit of NEPA. DOE has determined that this proposed rule qualifies for categorical exclusion under 10 CFR part 1021, subpart D, appendix A6, because it is a strictly procedural rulemaking and no extraordinary circumstances exist that require further environmental analysis. Therefore, DOE has determined that promulgation of these amendments is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of NEPA, and does not require an EA or an EIS.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Review Under Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
          <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601<E T="03">et seq.</E>) requires preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that by law must be proposed for public comment, unless the agency certifies that the rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As required by Executive Order 13272, “Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking,” 67 FR 53461 (August 16, 2002), DOE published procedures and policies on February 19, 2003, to ensure that the potential impacts of its rules on small entities are properly considered during the rulemaking process (68 FR 7990). DOE has made its procedures and policies available on the Office of General Counsel's Web site:<E T="03">http://gc.doe.gov</E>.</P>
          <P>DOE has reviewed today's proposed rule under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the procedures and policies published on February 19, 2003. The proposed revisions to 10 CFR part 1021 streamline the environmental review for proposed actions, resulting in a decrease in burdens associated with carrying out such reviews. For example, the proposed revisions are expected to reduce in aggregate the number of EAs that DOE is required to prepare, thus reducing the burden on applicants to prepare an EA for DOE's consideration, pay for the preparation of an EA, and/or provide environmental information for DOE's use in preparing an EA. During the past 10 years, DOE has completed approximately 30 EAs per year. The number of EAs completed each year has not varied significantly. However, in 2010, DOE expects to complete more than 75 EAs which reflect an increase in the number of proposed projects as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. DOE expects the number of EAs it prepares after 2010 will be closer to historical norms. The cost per EA has ranged from $3,000 to $630,000; the average and median cost has been $100,000 and $65,000, respectively. DOE expects that although the number of EAs it prepares annually could increase in response to recent emphasis on certain program areas, such as renewable energy technologies, proposed new categorical exclusions in these areas would reduce the number of EAs that might otherwise be required. In addition, the costs of making a categorical exclusion determination are less than those to prepare an EA. DOE estimates that DOE's administrative costs for research, staff time, and Web-posting for a categorical exclusion determination would most likely be less than $2,000 on average. Applicants may sometimes incur costs in providing environmental information DOE requires when making a categorical exclusion determination. While DOE does not have data on such applicant costs, DOE estimates that such costs would be similar to DOE's costs for a categorical exclusion determination, and much less than the cost of a typical EA. Although the number of EAs that would be avoided and the associated costs saved by applicants is uncertain, the proposed revisions are expected to result in a net decrease in environmental review costs and thus, are expected to have a beneficial cost impact. DOE estimates that approximately 15 percent of the EAs prepared in the last 10 years were funded by applicants, while the other 85 percent were funded by DOE. Although DOE does not have data on what percentage of those applicants qualified as small entities, a beneficial cost impact is expected to be felt by entities of all sizes.</P>
          <P>On the basis of the foregoing, DOE tentatively certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis for this proposed rulemaking. DOE's certification and supporting statement of factual basis will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).</P>

          <P>This proposed rulemaking will impose no new information or record-keeping requirements. Accordingly, OMB clearance is not required under the Paperwork Reduction Act. (44 U.S.C. 3501<E T="03">et seq.</E>)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Review Under Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
          <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4) generally requires Federal agencies to examine closely the impacts of regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments. Subsection 101(5) of title I of that law defines a Federal intergovernmental mandate to include any regulation that would impose upon State, local, or Tribal governments an enforceable duty, except a condition of Federal assistance or a duty arising from participating in a voluntary Federal program. Title II of that law requires each Federal agency to assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or to the private sector, other than to the extent such actions merely incorporate requirements specifically set forth in a statute. Section 202 of that title requires a Federal agency to perform a detailed assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of any rule that includes a Federal mandate which may result in costs to State, local, or Tribal governments, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year (adjusted annually for inflation). 2 U.S.C. 1532(a) and (b). Section 204 of that title requires each agency that proposes a rule containing a significant Federal intergovernmental mandate to develop an effective process for obtaining meaningful and timely input from elected officers of State, local, and Tribal governments. 2 U.S.C. 1534.</P>
          <P>The proposed rule would amend DOE's existing regulations governing compliance with NEPA to better align DOE's regulations, particularly its categorical exclusions, with its current activities and recent experiences, and update the provisions with respect to current technologies and regulatory requirements. The proposed rule would not result in the expenditure by State, local, and Tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. Accordingly, no assessment or analysis is required under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</P>

          <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105-277) requires Federal agencies to issue a Family Policymaking Assessment for any proposed rule that may affect family well being. The proposed rule would not have any impact on the autonomy or integrity of the family as an institution. Accordingly, DOE has<PRTPAGE P="238"/>concluded that it is not necessary to prepare a Family Policymaking Assessment.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Review Under Executive Order 13132</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 13132, “Federalism,” 64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999) imposes certain requirements on agencies formulating and implementing policies or regulations that preempt State law or that have federalism implications. Agencies are required to examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the States and carefully assess the necessity for such actions. DOE has examined this proposed rule and has determined that it would not preempt State law and would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. No further action is required by Executive Order 13132.</P>

          <P>With respect to the review of existing regulations and the promulgation of new regulations, section 3(a) of Executive Order 12988, “Civil Justice Reform,” 61 FR 4729 (February 7, 1996), imposes on Executive agencies the general duty to adhere to the following requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity; (2) write regulations to minimize litigation; and (3) provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard and promote simplification and burden reduction. With regard to the review required by section 3(a), section 3(b) of Executive Order 12988 specifically requires that Executive agencies make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly specifies any effect on existing Federal law or regulation; (3) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct while promoting simplification and burden reduction; (4) specifies the retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately defines key terms; and (6) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship under any guidelines issued by the Attorney General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 12988 requires Executive agencies to review regulations in light of applicable standards in section 3(a) and section 3(b) to determine whether they are met or it is unreasonable to meet one or more of them. DOE has completed the required review and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, the proposed rule meets the relevant standards of Executive Order 12988.</P>

          <P>The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516 note) provides for agencies to review most disseminations of information to the public under guidelines established by each agency pursuant to general guidelines issued by OMB.</P>
          <P>OMB's guidelines were published at 67 FR 8452 (February 22, 2002), and DOE's guidelines were published at 67 FR 62446 (October 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed today's proposed rule under the OMB and DOE guidelines and has concluded that it is consistent with applicable policies in those guidelines.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Review Under Executive Order 13211</HD>
          <P>Executive Order 13211, “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,” 66 FR 28355 (May 22, 2001) requires Federal agencies to prepare and submit to OMB a Statement of Energy Effects for any proposed significant energy action. A “significant energy action” is defined as any action by an agency that promulgated or is expected to lead to promulgation of a final rule, and that: (1)(i) Is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, or any successor order, and (ii) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; or (2) is designated by the Administrator of OIRA as a significant energy action. For any proposed significant energy action, the agency must give a detailed statement of any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use should the proposal be implemented, and of reasonable alternatives to the action and their expected benefits on energy supply, distribution, and use. Today's regulatory action would not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy, and is therefore not a significant energy action. Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a Statement of Energy Effects.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Level of NEPA review.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart identifies DOE actions that normally:</P>
              <P>(1) Do not require preparation of either an EIS or an EA (are categorically excluded from preparation of either document) (appendices A and B to this subpart D);</P>
              <P>(2) Require preparation of an EA, but not necessarily an EIS (appendix C to this subpart D); or</P>
              <P>(3) Require preparation of an EIS (appendix D to this subpart D).</P>
              <P>(b) Any completed, valid NEPA review does not have to be repeated, and no completed NEPA documents need to be redone by reasons of these regulations, except as provided in § 1021.314.</P>
              <P>(c) If a DOE proposal is encompassed within a class of actions listed in the appendices to this subpart D, DOE shall proceed with the level of NEPA review indicated for that class of actions, unless there are extraordinary circumstances related to the specific proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal.</P>
              <P>(d) If a DOE proposal is not encompassed within the classes of actions listed in the appendices to this subpart D, or if there are extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal, DOE shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Prepare an EA and, on the basis of that EA, determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI; or</P>
              <P>(2) Prepare an EIS and ROD.</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SUBJECT>Application of categorical exclusions (classes of actions that normally do not require EAs or EISs).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The actions listed in appendices A and B to this subpart D are classes of actions that DOE has determined do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (categorical exclusions).</P>
              <P>(b) To find that a proposal is categorically excluded, DOE shall determine the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The proposal fits within a class of actions that is listed in appendix A or B to this subpart D;</P>
              <P>(2) There are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposal that may affect the significance of the environmental effects of the proposal. Extraordinary circumstances are unique situations presented by specific proposals, including, but not limited to, scientific controversy about the environmental effects of the proposal; uncertain effects or effects involving unique or unknown risks; and unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources; and</P>
              <P>(3) The proposal has not been segmented to meet the definition of a categorical exclusion. Segmentation can occur when a proposal is broken down into small parts in order to avoid the appearance of significance of the total action. The scope of a proposal must include the consideration of connected and cumulative actions, that is, the proposal is not connected to other actions with potentially significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.25(a)(1)), is not related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)), and is not precluded by 40 CFR 1506.1 or § 1021.211 of this part concerning limitations on actions during EIS preparation.</P>
              <P>(c) All categorical exclusions may be applied by any organizational element of DOE. The sectional divisions in appendix B to this subpart D are solely for purposes of organization of that appendix and are not intended to be limiting.</P>
              <P>(d) A class of actions includes activities foreseeably necessary to proposals encompassed within the class of actions (such as award of implementing grants and contracts, site preparation, purchase and installation of equipment, and associated transportation activities).</P>

              <P>(e) Categorical exclusion determinations for actions listed in appendix B shall be documented and made available to the public by posting online, generally within two weeks of the determination, unless additional time is needed in order to review and protect classified information, “confidential business information,” or other information that DOE would not disclose pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552). Posted categorical exclusion determinations shall not disclose classified information, “confidential business information,” or other information that DOE would not disclose pursuant to FOIA.

                <P>The classes of actions listed below include the following conditions as integral elements of the classes of actions. To fit within the classes of actions listed below, a proposal must be one that would not:</P>
                <P>(1) Threaten a violation of applicable statutory, regulatory, or permit requirements for environment, safety, and health, or similar requirements of DOE or Executive Orders;</P>
                <P>(2) Require siting and construction or major expansion of waste storage, disposal, recovery, or treatment facilities (including incinerators), but the proposal may include categorically excluded waste storage, disposal, recovery, or treatment actions or facilities;</P>
                <P>(3) Disturb hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, or CERCLA-excluded petroleum and natural gas products that preexist in the environment such that there would be uncontrolled or unpermitted releases; or</P>
                <P>(4) Have the potential to cause significant impacts on environmentally sensitive resources. An environmentally sensitive resource is typically a resource that has been identified as needing protection through Executive Order, statute, or regulation by Federal, State, or local government, or a Federally recognized Indian Tribe. An action may be categorically excluded if, although sensitive resources are present, the action would not have the potential to cause significant impacts on those resources (such as construction of a building with its foundation well above a sole-source aquifer or upland surface soil removal on a site that has wetlands). Environmentally sensitive resources include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Property (such as sites, buildings, structures, and objects) of historic, archeological, or architectural significance designated by Federal, State, or local governments, or a Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or property determined to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;</P>
                <P>(ii) Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or their habitat (including critical habitat) or Federally-proposed or candidate species or their habitat (Endangered Species Act); State-listed endangered or threatened species or their habitat; and Federally-protected marine mammals and Essential Fish Habitat (Marine Mammals Protection Act; Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act);</P>
                <P>(iii) Floodplains and wetlands (as defined in 10 CFR 1022.4, “Compliance with Floodplain and Wetland Environmental Review Requirements: Definitions,” or its successor);</P>
                <P>(iv) Areas having a special designation such as Federally- and State-designated wilderness areas, national parks, national monuments, national natural landmarks, wild and scenic rivers, State and Federal wildlife refuges, scenic areas (such as National Scenic and Historic Trails or National Scenic Areas), and marine sanctuaries;</P>
                <P>(v) Prime or unique farmland, or other farmland of statewide or local importance, as defined at 7 CFR 658.2(a), “Farmland Protection Policy Act: Definitions,” or its successor;</P>
                <P>(vi) Special sources of water (such as sole-source aquifers, wellhead protection areas, and other water sources that are vital in a region); and</P>

Custodial services are activities to preserve facility appearance, working conditions, and sanitation (such as cleaning, window washing, lawn mowing, trash collection, painting, and snow removal). Routine maintenance activities, corrective (that is, repair), preventive, and predictive, are required to maintain and preserve buildings, structures, infrastructures, and equipment in a condition suitable for a facility to be used for its designated purpose. Such maintenance may occur as a result of severe weather (such as hurricanes, floods, and tornados), wildfires, and other such events. Routine maintenance may result in replacement to the extent that replacement is in-kind and is not a substantial upgrade or improvement. In-kind replacement includes installation of new components to replace outmoded components, provided that the replacement does not result in a significant change in the expected useful life, design capacity, or function of the facility. Routine maintenance does not include replacement of a major component that significantly extends the originally intended useful life of a facility (for example, it does not include the replacement of a reactor vessel near the end of its useful life). Routine maintenance activities include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(a) Repair or replacement of facility equipment, such as lathes, mills, pumps, and presses;</P>
                <P>(b) Door and window repair or replacement;</P>
